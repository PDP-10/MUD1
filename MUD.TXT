	Dense forest.
	You are wandering around in some dense forest.
bunker
	Coal bunker.
	You are in a coal bunker, just off the cellar. The only way out is
	to the east, where there is the cellar doorway. The atmosphere is thick
	with coal dust. To the south is a very small tunnel which you couldn't
	possibly enter even if you tried. The coal dust is particularly
	thick and dusty in the region near the door.

	%nfrst1
	You are wandering around in some dense forest, to the southwest of a
	pleasant pasture, to the east of a perilous cliff and to the south of
	a thundering waterfall. To the southeast is a glade in the forest.
sfrst2	light
	%nfrst1
	You are wandering around in some dense forest, to the south of a
	pleasant pasture, and to the west of a fuming swamp. To the southwest
	the forest opens up onto a magical glade.
glade	light
	Magical glade.
	You are in a magical glade, surrounded by forest. East and west it
	looks inpenetrable, but in the northerly directions the trees are
	less dense. In the southerly directions, the trees are of soft pine,
	and through them to the southwest can be glimpsed a sundial.
wabe	light
	Sundial in pine forest.
	This is part of a large pine forest. To the northeast, the forest opens
	up onto a magical glade, but in other directions is more forest, some
	of it too dense to allow passage. Before you stands an old, stone
	sundial, overgrown with ivy.
sett	light
	Entrance to badger's sett.
	You are in part of a large pine forest. Northwest, the forest opens up
	onto a magical glade, and in all other directions the forest continues,
	although in some the trees are too thick to permit passage. In front of
	you, in the ground, a hole leads downwards into a badger's sett.
insett	small	nolook
	Inside badger's sett.
	You are inside a small sett belonging to a badger. It looks as though
	the badger is hidden in a smaller hole above the entrance, but there is
	no conceivable way you can reach him. The room looks the ideal place to
	store objects, since the badger acts as guard. The only way out is up.
pines1	light
	Pine forest.
	You are wandering about amongst some soft pine trees. To the north the
	forest clears to become a glade, but everywhere else are more trees.
	Through the foliage to the northwest can be glimpsed a sundial.

	Eastwards, through the trees, can be glimpsed something resembling a
	bandstand.
sqrm	light	nolook
	Squirrel part of forest.
	This is the part of the forest used by squirrels, however they all
	scampered off when they heard you coming. All around you is forest,
	some passable, some not.
sqroom	light	nolook	dmove	sqrm
	%sqrm
	This is the part of the forest used by squirrels, and when you enter
	they all come scampering up to you, very playfully. In all directions
	is forest. The squirrels (all of which are red, naturally) are very
	happy to see you.
pines4	light
	%pines1
	You are wandering around amongst some soft pine trees. All about you
	are more, some densely packed and others allowing passage through. To
	the northeast through the trees can be made out a wooden building
	something like a bandstand. To the southeast there looks to be some
	sort of religious shrine.

bstand	light
	Bandstand.
	You are stood in a bandstand in the midst of the pine forest. All around
	you are trees, denser in the easterly directions than in the westerly
	ones. The bandstand hasn't been used for some time, obviously with it
	being in the middle of a forest, and in places its paint is peeling, but
	it is nevertheless a surprisingly fine example.
gaptrm	light
	Golden appletree in pine forest.
	This part of the forest was obviously once an orchard in years gone by,
	since in among the firs can be seen appletrees, although they are
	sadly fruitless. However, one tree is taller than the rest, and
	coloured an enchanted golden.

	You are wandering around amongst some soft pine trees. All about you
	are more, some densely packed and others allowing passage through.
bbath	light
	Bird bath in pine forest.
	You are stood in amongst the trees of a pine forest. All around, the
	forest continues, although in some directions the trees are too thick
	to allow passage. Stood before you is an ornate stone birdbath, but
	the water it contains is not drinkable.

	the entrance to a misty graveyard.
track1	light
	Beaten track near cliff.
	You are at the end of a rough track. There is a dangerous cliff to
	the west marked "Lovers' leap".
track2	light
	Beaten track.
	You're on a rough east - west track with a dense forest to the
	north and pasture to the south.
ostart	light
	Road opposite cottage.
	You are standing on a badly paved road with a cemetery to the north
	and the home of a grave-digger to the south. An inscription on the
	cemetery gates reads, "RESTING PLACE OF LOST SOULS".
road2	light
	Narrow road.
	You are on a narrow east-west road with forest to the north and
	gorse scrub to the south.
start	light	startrm
	Narrow road between lands.
	You are stood on a narrow road between The Land and whence you came.
	To the north and south are the small foothills of a pair of majestic
	mountains, with a large wall running round. To the west the road
	continues, where in the distance you can see a thatched cottage opposite
	an ancient cemetery. The way out is to the east, where a shroud of
	mist covers the secret pass by which you entered The Land.
wayout	light	nolook	chain	valley	road4
	You force yourself through the narrow, mist-covered gap...
wpstre	light
	West pasture.
	You are in comparatively pleasant pasture. To the south is a river, to
	the north a track. Eastwards the pasture is seen to continue, while to
	the northeast is the flower garden of a strange cottage. To the south
	flows a river.
clifff	light
	Cliff.
	You are standing on the edge of a cliff surrounded by forest to the
	north and a river to the south. A chill wind blows up the unclimbable and
	unscaled heights. At the base of the cliff you can just make out the
	shapes of jagged rocks.
fallin	light	dmove	beach	nolook
	Falling off cliff.
	You are falling off a very high cliff onto a beach.
slidin	nolook	dmove	uland3
	Sliding down chute.
	You are sliding down a slippery tunnel, twisting and turning tunnel at
	great speed.
epstre	light
	East pasture.
	Around you is a delightful pasture. To the south is a fast flowing
	stream. Further north and east you can see a woodman's hut and to
	the north is gorse scrub. Northwestwards you can see a strange,
	forbidding cottage, which you can enter via its french windows.
spstre	light
	South pasture.
	All about you is a pleasant pasture. To the north is a fast-flowing
	stream, and to the south is forest. Westwards is a thundering waterfall.
garden	light	nolook
	Flower garden.
	You are in a well-kept garden. There is an unexpectedly sweet smell
	here and you notice lots of flowers. To the east across a path there
	is more garden.
path	light
	Path.
	You are standing on a path which leads off a road to the north, to a
	cottage south of you. To the west and east are separate gardens.
patch	light
	Vegetable garden.
	You are standing in the middle of what was obviously a vegetable
	garden. However it has not been tended for years and most of the
	vegetables have run wild.
gorse	light
	Gorse.
	You are in a tangled mass of prickly gorse.
wfall	light
	Waterfall.
	Before you is an awe-inspiring sight; a waterfall plummets over a
	cliff and explodes in a dazzling crescendo of rainbow colour on the
	menacing rocks below.
river1	light
	River.
	You are on the bank of a fast flowing river with pasture to the north
	and forest to the south.
river2	light
	%river1
	You are on the bank of a fast flowing river with pasture to the north
	and forest to the south.
rapids	light
	Rapids.
	You are on the bank of some dangerous rapids. Beyond them to the east
	the river goes underground; to the west it continues out of sight, and
	you can hear a thundering as of falling water from that direction. To
	the south can be seen (and smelled!) a fuming swamp, and southeast is a
	small pond.
mfrst	light
	Forest near mountains.
	You are in dense forest at the base of some snow-capped mountains,
	wreathed in clouds. The foothills are so beautiful that you yearn to
	be able to climb them and lie eternally in dew drenched grass, with
	an air of inner peace and total tranquility. You realise, however, that
	this is silly!
cave	light
	Cave.
	This is a cave, wherein once dwelled a hermit in times long passed.
	Above is a huge mountain towering amongst the clouds, and outside
	can be seen a pasture, small cottage and a cemetery in the distance.
	At the east end of the cave is a small opening in the wall.
pond1	light
	Pond in swamp.
	This is a small, shallow freshwater pond, fed by a small brook joining it
	to the river. It is too shallow to swim, and there are no edible fish
	living in it. Northwest are rapids, but everywhere else is swamp.
nhill1	light
	Foothills.
	You are in the foothills, such as they are, to a tall mountain.
	To the south is an east-west road, and to the north more small hillocks.
	Westwards lies a forest, but passage east is impossible because of
	a huge stone wall which blocks the way, built to keep the denizens of
	The Land away from the surrounding area...
nhill2	light
	%nhill1
	You are in some higher foothills of the mountains, but the way north
	and east is blocked by a huge wall. More foothills are downwards to
	the south, and to the west is forest. In the distance can be seen a
	small, thatched cottage, and some wide, open, pastures.
shill1	light
	%nhill1
	These are some foothills to the tall mountains which tower above you
	to the east. Travel in that direction is impossible because of a tall
	stone wall, built by the locals when they learned of the creatures
	dwelling within The Land... To the north runs an east-west road, and
	to the west is forest. The hills rise slowly to the south.
shill2	light
	%nhill1
	This is a small hillock atop a cave. To the north the hill slopes
	downwards, but to the east and south curves a stone wall which is
	impossible to scale. Below can be seen a stream cascading over another
	cliff further west, and beyond that is the sea.
lounge	light
	Lounge.
	This is the lounge. Around you are some pieces of elegant troll-hide
	furniture, although all the portable ones have long been stolen so
	there's no point in getting any... Ahead of you to the south is the
	dining area, and to the west is the hall. An archway to the east leads
	to the study.
dining	light
	Dining area.
	You are standing in the dining area of a long narrow room. To the north
	is the lounge, to the west is a serving hatch which, you surmise, leads
	to the kitchen (although it's too small to climb through). To the south
	are some french windows which open out over a pasture.
kitche	light
	Kitchen.
	Around you is all the usual paraphernalia that can found in a kitchen,
	although it is firmly fixed down so you can't take any of it away.
	The pantry is to the northwest, and a doorway to the hall is to the
	north. East is a small serving hatch through which you can see, if not
	move to, the dining room.
hall	light
	Hall.
	You are standing in an oddly shaped hall. To the south is a doorway,
	the east is an archway, and some dark forbidding stairs lead upwards
	to the southeast. Immediately to the west is a fitted wardrobe, and
	some eerie, granite steps to the southwest lead downwards to the cellar.
study	light
	Study.
	This is the old study used by the gravedigger who once owned this
	cottage, where he read up his craft. It is decorated in sombre colours,
	and the windows are small and dirty. On the south wall is a large
	bookcase reaching up to the ceiling, made of an enchanted oak.
ssteps
	Secret steps.
	These are some secret steps leading downwards through a false wall to
	the underworld. At the bottom, to the south, is darkness; at the top,
	to the north, stands a large bookcase, acting as a doorway between here
	and a study.
zroom
	Zombie room.
	This is a small room at the bottom of a short flight of steps leading
	up to the north. The walls are damp, and covered in fungal stains.
	To the south is a narrow passage leading downwards.
downps
	Narrow passage.
	This is a small passage leading downwards to the south. To the north
	is a small room, and at the other end a door inscribed with strange
	runes.
sorcrm	light	silent
	Sorcerer's room.
	You look around you in disbelief at the exotic room which you have
	discovered. It seems to be a room used by some sorcerer, wherein he
	bound his spells and worked his magic. The room is lit by an
	illusory red light, and many of the strange objects you see defy
	description. To the north is a door inscribed with strange runic
	symbols, but there is no other exit.
stairs	light
	Halfway up the stairs.
	You are sitting on a step halfway up the stairs, a ghostly voice
	recites a poem by A. A. Milne to itself. Further up you can make out
	a landing, downwards you can see a hallway.
landin	light
	Upstairs landing.
	You are standing on the upstairs landing. There are doorways in most
	directions, the stairs lead downwards and to the northwest.
bathrm	light	small
	Bathroom.
	The bathroom contains a toilet and a handbasin, and on the wall is a
	shelf with "MEDICINES" written on it. The bath was removed long ago,
	but the toilet and handbasin still look usable. The only exit is to the
	east.
cupd1	light	small
	Airing cupboard.
	This is a small cupboard, most of which is filled with a hot water
	tank. The rest of the cupboard is filled with shelving.
bdrm01	light
	Large bedroom.
	You are standing in a large bedroom. To the south is a window out of
	which, you can see a pleasant field with a stream flowing swiftly at
	the bottom of it. There is a doorway to the north.
bdrm02	light
	Main bedroom.
	This is the main bedroom. There is a window to the north from which
	you can see the road that runs past the front of the cottage. The way out
	is south, onto the landing.
bdrm03	light
	Small bedroom.
	The room appears to have been used as a nursery at some time as the
	walls are covered with pictures of elves and gnomes all smiling
	happily. There is a fitted cupboard to the southwest and the way out
	is to the northwest.
cupd2	small	light
	Fitted cupboard.
	The cupboard appears to be bereft of any shelving, there are scratches
	on the wall but there is nothing here which can explain them.
wrdbe	light	small
	Fitted wardrobe.
	You are inside the fitted wardrobe. The only apparent exit is to the
	east, into a hallway.
pantry	small
	Pantry.
	You are standing in the pantry. Around you are some marble slabs
	and shelves which are badly damaged and not worth anything, but
	which have obviously once held mouthwatering delicacies of rare
	and ancient types.
hut	light
	Woodsman's hut.
	The hut is obviously the home of a woodsman. There are various pieces
	of rude wooden furniture scattered about. On the walls are stuffed
	fish and birds, they appear old and are fixed firmly to the wall as
	if the owner has treasured them for a long time.

beach	light	nolook
	Rocky Beach.
	You are standing on a rocky beach. Above you is a mighty cliff which
	extends out to the sea on either side of you, thus forming an enclosed
	cove. Behind you is a forbidding tunnel, and to the south a mighty
	waterfall smashes into the rocks in another part of the beach. Out to
	the west, in the sea, can be seen a wrecked galleon, trapped on some
	vicious rocks.
beach2	light	nolook
	Bottom of waterfall.
	You are stood on a sandy part of a beach, at the bottom of a
	thundering waterfall which smashes into the rocks from the cliff
	above. To the north is a rockier part of the beach, but otherwise
	the area is cut off by the sea apart from some slippery rocks to the
	south. To the west, in the sea, can be seen the wreckage of a
	galleon, torn against some vicious rocks.

inlet	light
	Concealed inlet.
	This is a small inlet from the sea, concealed from view by some
	slippery rocks to the northwest. Out at sea to the west can be seen
	the wreckage of a galleon, and above you towers a mighty cliff. There
	is a bird's nest above, the route to which looks climbable.
nest	light
	Eagle's nest.
	This is the nest of an eagle, stuck firmly to the cliff overlooking the
	sea. Out at sea can be seen a ship on some vicious rocks, and there
	is a strong current whirling around except to the north from west of
	the inlet. The cliff above here is unclimbable.

	Small bay.
	You are in a small bay, skirted by strong currents. To the north is
	a steep slope, which the swirling flows about you make the only safe

	upon which is a huge circle of weatherbeaten stones.

	relative tranquility of these coastal waters continues.
sea12	light	sanctuary	nolook	dmove	beach3

	You are at sea, close to the coastline to the east. Northwards and

	coast. Elsewhere, however, it is rough and sailing there would probably
	deposit you in Davy Jones's locker...
sea13	light	sanctuary	nolook	dmove	beach3

	You are out at sea, to the south of some vicious rocks upon which lies
	a wrecked galleon. Some way to the east can be seen an inlet at the foot
	of a tall cliff, and south, through strong currents on either side, is
	a small island upon which has been built a large archway.
sea16	light	sanctuary	nolook	dmove	inlet
	%sea1
	You are sailing north of a small island in the middle of rough seas.
	The only calm waters lie further north, where in the distance can be
	seen a galleon, wrecked on some vicious rocks.
woe1	light
	North part of Isle of Woe.
	You are standing on a small island, way out to sea. The waters are
	relatively calm, but too far in any direction save north and they
	become dangerous. A large, ancient archway straddles the island, its
	faces well eroded over many thousands of years. To reach the southern
	part of the island you would have to pass through it.
woe2	light
	South part of Isle of Woe.
	You find youself stood in the southern half of a small, windswept
	island, separated from the northern half by a large archway which
	stands from shore to shore. The seas around here sweep swiftly
	northwards, too, but are not dangerous close to the island.
fslop1	light
	Forest on steep slope.
	You are in dense forest, sloping from the south downwards to the north.

	You are in dense forest, sloping from the south downwards to the north.
	To the southeast are the foothills of an enormous mountain.

	%fslop2
	You are in dense forest, sloping from the south downwards to the north.
	To the west can be heard the roar of the sea, as it crashes into the
	cliffs beyond the trees.
sdale	light
	South dale.
	This is a peaceful dale, nestled at the base of a huge afforested
	escarpment which slopes steeply away to the south. Northwards is
	another forest, and eastwards the overgrown grounds of a mausoleum,
	dwarfed by an enormous mountain which stands high above. The dale
	curves away to the northwest, and westwards is a dangerous cliff.
ogrnds	light
	Overgrown grounds of mausoleum.
	This once well-tended garden has now, sadly, fallen into a state of
	neglect. Stood within, its doorway to the southeast, is a cold,
	bemossed mausoleum. The scene is dominated by a huge cliff to the
	east, at the base of an awe-inspiring mountain which climbs away
	into the clouds, its foothills sweeping down into a steep escarpment
	covered in forest to the south. North is more forest, and west a dale.
	To the northeast there looks to be a railway cutting.
mosolm
	Mausoleum.
	You are stood inside a piece of history, a mausoleum which is far more
	ancient than its weatherbeaten exterior would indicate. Within the
	circular walls are the tombs of many, their names and heraldic designs
	carved into the stones in a language which was dead before Atlantis
	sank. The easiest exit from this eerie window on the past is to the
	northwest. On the floor, however, is carved an inscription in an
	archaic predecessor of your own language, which is readable. The floor
	and ceiling do not have entrances, but the tombs seem to.
ntomb
	North tomb.
	This is the north tomb of the mausoleum, but the bones of the dead
	have long since been reduced to dust by Time. The walls are close
	together, and there is no evidence of there having been a coffin
	within. The exit is to the south.
wtomb
	West tomb.
	This side-room is the west tomb of the mausoleum. An enormous
	sarcophagus is lain against the back wall, and the way out is to the
	east, leading back into the mausoleum entrance hall.
stomb
	South tomb.
	This small chamber is the southern tomb of the mausoleum, which has
	not been used for burial purposes. The exit is to the north, and the
	walls are curiously uninteresting.
swtomb
	Southwest tomb.
	This tomb is to the southwest of the mausoleum, and is quite richly
	decorated. The walls are stained a regal purple, and the floor is a
	mosaic of intricate design. The whole room has an eastern aura, and
	bears many gilt symbols in a language you cannot recognise inlaid
	upon the door.
etomb
	East tomb.
	This room consists the eastern tomb of the mausoleum, and is the
	oldest part of the structure. Strange cobwebs adorn the far wall,
	and the light casts dancing shadows on the roof which seem to come to
	life in this relic of prehistory. The only exit is to the west.
setomb
	Southeast tomb.
	This is the southeastern tomb of the mausoleum, and has not been used
	for burial purposes. The unplastered walls and uneven floor give a
	sense of starkness which makes the uneasy mind wary, lest some
	uncanny spirit has made the deathly room its abode.
dcliff	light
	Dangerous cliff.
	You are stood by the edge of a dangerous, partly-forested cliff,
	which slopes downwards to the north. To the east and south, the forest
	becomes thicker, and to the northeast the slope levels out onto a dale.
	The crumbling eroded western edge of the cliff looks so liable to
	collapse that no-one in their right mind would risk certain death by
	leaping off.
scrubs	light
	Scrub slope.
	This is a gentle slope down westwards to a beach, covered in scrubs
	and small bushes. To the south, the slope becomes much steeper, and
	rises into a huge escarpment high above. Eastwards is a dale, and
	northwards runs an east-west section of railway line.
wdale	light
	West dale.
	This is a pleasant dale, hugging the slopes of a huge forest-covered
	escarpment which rises to the south. East is more forest, but the
	dale curves southeastwards behind it. West is a slope of scrubland,
	which rolls down to the sea beyond. North is a railway line, which
	runs from east to west, standard gauge.
forist	light
	%nfrst1
	You are stood in a dense forest, with a railway line to the north
	and a pleasant dale to the south and west.
cuttin	light
	Railway cutting.
	You are stood on a shallow mound, which has been cut through by a
	now rusting railway line, in an east-west direction to the north. To
	the south is a mausoleum in overgrown grounds, the remnants of a
	surrounding fence no longer preventing entry. East and west are forests,
	and southwest is a dale at the bottom of a long, steep slope.
efrst1	light
	Forest at base of cliff.
	The forest in which you stand is nestled at the base of a frighteningly
	tall mountain which rises off in an unclimbable cliff to the east.
	From inside it, to the north, appears to run a railway line, which
	cuts through a shallow mound to the west. South stands a cold, grey
	mausoleum in overgrown grounds, protected ineffectually by the remains
	of a fence which long since rotted away to virtually nothing.
emine	light
	Entrance to mine.
	This is the entrance to an underground tin mine, beneath a huge
	cliff. Outside is to the west, and down to the east runs a main
	passage into the mine proper. Both directions is a railway track,
	overgrown enough to show it hasn't been used for many a year.
main1	light
	Main passage.
	This is the main passage in the tin mine, running east-west. Light
	comes from the west end, whereas the east delves deeper underground.
	The length of the passage there runs a rusted railway track.
main2	light
	%main1
	This is the junction on the main passage in the mine. To the west,
	whence comes light, the passage rises. Also in this direction runs
	a railway track, although it stops where you are now standing. To
	the north is a major shaft, and upwards to the east are some roughly
	hewn but well-worn steps. The passage continues to the southeast. The
	floor of this room seems to be slightly wet.
platfm
	Platform.
	This is a sort of landing at the top of some steps which lead
	down to the west. To the east is a major shaft, which runs upwards,
	and to the north is a makeshift shed. The platform looks well used.
shed
	Shed.
	This is a decrepit but nevertheless rather sturdy shed, used by the
	tin-miners in the old days to store their equipment. The way out is
	to the south, onto a platform at the top of a staircase.
valvrm
	Valve on staircase.
	You are halfway up (or down!) a staircase carved into the rock,
	although it is well used. Fixed solidly into the wall is a rusted
	wheel valve-release, of the sort used in large plumbing work. In
	contrast to the stairs, it looks hardly used at all...
shaft1	dmove	minor1
	Vertical shaft.
	This is a vertical shaft, quite long, but easy to traverse because
	of the iron rungs hammered into its sides. Such shafts were used long
	ago by the tin-miners to reach the faces. At the top end, to the
	south, is a main passage. Similarily, there is a minor passage at the
	bottom, to the east.
shaft2	dmove	platfm
	%shaft1
	This is a vertical shaft, which you find yourself able to climb
	because of the heavy iron rungs forced deep into the rock. At the
	bottom end, to the west, is a main passage; at the top, however,
	there is only a minor passage, to the north.
main3
	%main1
	This is a three-way junction in the main passage. Exits are upwards
	to the northwest, downwards to the southwest, or to the east.
main4
	%main1
	You are walking down a main passage in the tin mine. To the east is
	a vertical shaft, whereas the passage turns downwards to the south
	and upwards to the west.
shaft3	dmove	minor7
	%shaft1
	This is a vertical shaft leading deep underground. At the top end, to
	the west, is a main passageway; at the bottom end, to the south,
	there is a minor one. The shaft is climbable because of heavy
	iron rungs biting into the sides, although the walls are a bit damp.
main5
	%main1
	This is a main passage in the tin mine, running up to the northeast
	and curving down to the south. There is a fair amount of rubble
	around, as though there has been a cave-in nearby at some time in
	the past.
main7
	%main1
	This is a north-south main passage, which although clear at the
	north end, runs into a pile of rubble to the south. It is plain that
	the pit-props have given way some time, and the way through is almost
	impossible. You might be able to travel south, however, if you were
	to drop everything you're carrying...

	You find yourself in a main tunnel, which although clear at the

	probably negotiate the cave-in if you were to drop everthing, but
	you won't be able to see if you do...
minor1
	Minor passage.
	This is a minor passage, at the base of a shaft to the west. It
	continues to the east, towards the tin face. There is a narrow
	crack to the southwest, but you'd have to drop everything to be
	able to pass through.
minor2
	%minor1
	You are walking along a narrow passage, which splits three ways.
	To the west, it continues upwards; to the south, it bends away
	downwards; to the east, it meets the face, from where tin used
	to be mined using picks.
face1
	Face.
	This is one of the faces upon which work was proceeding when the
	mine closed down. The only way out is to the west, to the previous
	face, now a minor passage.

shaft4	dmove	tightp
	%shaft1
	This vertical shaft is exceedingly long, but ascent and descent is
	facilitated by heavy iron rungs set into the walls. At the top end,
	to the north, is a minor passage. At the bottom, to the south, is
	a tight passage, which looks hardly used.
tightp	small
	Tight passage.
	This is a very small and tight passage, and it is something of an
	effort to enter although no-one need drop anything to do so. To
	the south is a hardly-worked tin face; indeed, it looks like work
	was in progress to widen the tunnel when the mine closed. To the
	east is a crack, leading into the rock.
face4
	%face1
	This is one of the tin faces, where in years gone by the tin miners
	would cut away to reach the ore. The only way out is to the north
	onto a tight passage.
doomrm	light
	Doom room.
	As soon as you enter, a section of floor gives way and you find
	yourself falling into a pit. The finely-balanced rock slides
	back above your head, and you find yourself stuck.

	Crack room.
	Hello wizard, guess what mortals can't see without help? Try ne or w.
edwrlm
	Entrance to dwarf realm.
	You find yourself crouched in a low passage, obviously the work of
	dwarfs, with a crack in the rock to the west and an ornamented
	archway to the southeast. You realise that this must be the entrance to
	the fabulous dwarf realm, about which there are many terrible legends.
minor5
	%minor1
	Where you are now is a minor passage at the top of a vertical shaft to
	the south. Eastwards, the passage continues, and to the north is a
	side passage, which seems to have been started in error, and abandoned.
minor6
	%minor1
	This is a minor passage, leading from the west to a tin face to the
	east. South, there is a smooth-walled, vertical ventilator duct, or so
	it appears. It looks particularily dangerous, however, and smells of
	charcoal.

	%face1
	This is a tin face, moderately used. The exit is to the west into a
	minor passage.
sidpsg
	Side passage.
	This is the beginnings of a minor passage, but upon which work ceased
	early because of the hardness of the rock. The passage proper is to
	the south.

	This is another minor passage in the tin mine. It starts at the base of
	a shaft to the north, and continues to the south.
minor8

	This minor passage continues to the north, but bends onto a face to
	the east. There is one of the common roof collapses to the south,
	which you could probably traverse if you weren't carrying anything.

	%face1
	This is a frequently-used tin face, by the look of things, since it
	seems to have a high grade of tin, although most of it has now been

ledge1	light
	Ledge.
	You are stood on a ledge overlooking a fantastic sight. By light
	coming from what seems to be a hole high above you, you witness an
	incredible view of the fabled dwarf realm of legend. There is no way
	to get down from here, although far to the southwest there seems to be
	such an entrance. The ledge continues to the east.
ledge2	light
	%ledge1
	You are stood on the ledge, high above the dwarf realm. Although
	the view is awe-inspiring, you are careful to keep your footing
	lest you fall the many hundreds of feet and kill yourself below. The
	ledge continues to the east and west.
boledg
ledge3	light
	%ledge1
	This is the easternmost end of the ledge, which is a bit wider than
	the rest of it. Below you you can see a pasture, and some forests,
	but the scene is stolen by a dazzling dwarfen citadel in the centre
	of the cave below, which catches the mysterious light from above and
	spreads it out in a glorious cascade of sparkling colours.
bldg	light	nolook
	Bottom of ledge.
	You are stood at the bottom of the northern wall of this strange
	subterrainean domain. High above you can be seen a narrow ledge, but
	there are no means by which you can climb there from here. To the
	south is a pasture, now lying fallow.
dwpst1	light
	Dwarfen pasture.
	You are strolling across a pasture, used by the dwarfs for their
	crops, although now it is overgrown because it is the fallow year.
	To the north is the bottom of the northern wall, high up which is a
	ledge. East is a forest, and south the entrance to the dominating
	citadel.
befcit	light
	Before citadel.
	You are stood before a huge marble-covered citadel, the entrance
	to which is to the east. It is inset with coloured stones and
	catches the sun from high above to create a glorious rainbow effect.
	North and south are pastures, and to the west are steps up to a
	shelf in the rock, and an archway.
dwpst2	light
	%dwpst1
	This is a pasture to the south of the entrance to the citadel,
	the as yet unripe wheat swaying to and fro' to unseen winds. To the
	south and east are forests of oak.
panora	light
	Panoramic view.
	You are stood on a shelf in the rock, with a grand archway through
	into a passage to the northwest. This, however, is nothing compared
	to the spectacular sight to the east. You see that this is a cavern,
	light coming in by what seems to be a hole in the roof high above.
	Steps lead down to the base of a huge citadel, surrounded by a
	wall with forests beyond. To the northeast and southeast are two
	pastures, and from somewhere can be heard a running spring. The
	light reflecting from the citadel's marbled walls is so breathtaking
	you feel quite in awe.
ufrst1	light
	Underground forest.
	You are stood in a pleasant oak forest, with a pasture to the west.
	The forest continues to the southeast, but to the north is the cavern
	wall and to the south the wall of the citadel.

	This is a very agreeable oak forest through which you find yourself
	walking. To the north is a wheatfield, and to the southeast can be
	heard a spring.
spring	light
	Spring.
	You are stood in a leafy part of the forest. From the cave wall
	comes forth a spring, which tumbles into a little pool and seeps away
	again into the earth. All around is more wall, for this is a large
	crack, save to the northwest where the forest continues.
topcit	light
	Top of citadel.
	This is the top of the citadel, from where you can see all the
	surrounding cave. Directly above you can be seen a hole, high up in
	the mountain, and it occurs to you that this citadel was so placed
	as to catch the light precisely and create the wondrous effects
	visible elsewhere in the cavern. There is a gateway to the east.
ufrst5	light
	%ufrst1
	This is the forest at the back of the citadel. There is the cave
	wall to the east, but the forest continues northwest and southwest.
entrnc
	Entrance to citadel.
	You are stood at the entrance to the dwarfen citadel, at the top of
	some steps which run downwards to the east. West, a gateway provides
	the only other exit from the room. The walls are decorated in curious
	stones and wierd etchings, but none are removable or readable.
dwstep
	Dwarf steps.
	You are using some narrow, closely-spaced stairs, which descend in a
	straight line from a room to the west to a doorway to the east. At the
	top of the steps are strange decorations, presumably put there to
	ward off evil presences, such as yours...
dwhall
	Dwarfen hall.
	The room in which you stand is impressive in size, even by non-dwarf
	standards. High above is a red brick ceiling, and the floor is
	decorated by a colourful, if crudely-made, mosaic. There are low
	passages leading off to the north and east, and a higher passage to
	the south (probably so long weapons don't scratch the roof). West is
	a doorway, which looks well-used.
lowps1
	Low passage.
	You are walking down a low, well-trodden passage. To the north, the
	passage continues, and to the south it opens out into a large hall.
	East is what looks like a kitchen, and to the west is a doorway.
lowps2
	%lowps1
	You are stood in a low, dwarfen passage, which runs from the south,
	turns to the east, and continues. There is an opening on the north
	wall into a room, and to the west is a doorway.
lowps3
	%lowps1
	This is a low, east-west passage. At the west end, it continues on
	into the dark, but at the east end it opens up onto a comparatively
	large room. To the northeast is an opening, from which issues a
	peculiar odour.
dwfood
	Food store.
	This is the room the dwarfs who live here use to store their food
	supplies. It is packed full of assorted vittles and foodstuffs, most
	of which are in too small quantities for you to bother with. The only
	way out is through a doorway to the east.
dwstre
	Dwarf store.
	Herein, the dwarfs keep most of their equipment and tools. The walls
	are hung with assorted spades, clothes, planks of wood and the like,
	but most are too small for you to use. The only exit is a doorway to
	the east.
dwroom
	Dwarf room.
	This is a room which seems to have been recently constructed by the
	dwarfs who inhabit this realm, for at the moment it has no furnishings
	or even a door. The only way out is via an opening to the south which
	leads onto the bend of a low passage.
dwbog	small
	Dwarf lavatory.
	This is the small room the dwarfs use to excrete their waste bodily
	products. Although there is no door (the exit is an opening to the
	southwest), privacy is maintained by the room being on a slight
	upward slant, out of the line of sight from the passage outside.
	Understandably, being such a small room, there is a pungent odour here.
dwcant
	Canteen.
	This is the room where the dwarfs partake of their meals. It is quite
	large, and has a long table running down the middle, bolted to the
	ground. There are two low passages leaving the room; one to the west,
	and one to the south. To the southwest is a doorway, and there are no
	other exits. The walls are painted in pictures of grassy pastures.
dwktch
	Dwarf kitchen.
	You are stood in the dwarf kitchen, quite large and full of kitchen-
	like utensils which are regretably too small to be of use to you. There
	is a doorway to the northeast, with food stains on the floor near it,
	and an opening onto a low passage to the west. North is a pit in which
	refuse is thrown to decompose away.
dwpit	small
	Refuse pit.
	This evil-smelling room is where the dwarfs toss their rubbish, from
	the kitchen. All around are masses of decomposing foodstuffs, in
	various states of decay, and filty, broken articles not even the
	previous owners would be able to recognise. The only way out is via
	a short climb to the south.
lowps4
	%lowps1
	This is a low passage, leading from what appears to be a canteen to
	the north, to a doorway at the southern end.
lowps5
	%lowps1
	You are striding down a low passage, which forms a sort of T-junction.
	To the west, it leads into a large hall, and to the east it opens up
	into a room, whereas south, it carries on into the dark.
dwrm1
	Dwarf room.
	This is a general-purpose room, used by the dwarfs for some of their
	normal everyday activities. Strewn about it in a seemingly random
	fashion, yet firmly fixed to the floor, are various items of furniture
	and the like. There is a doorway to the north, and a low passage leading
	off to the west.
guard1
	Dwarf guard room.
	You are stood in a guard room built specifically to prevent access,
	presumably to the doorway which is to the south. There are crimson
	stains on the floor which have been unsuccessfully attempted to be
	removed. North is an opening onto a large hall, and southeast is
	another room.
guard2
	%guard1
	This is the inner guard room. The wall is decorated in battle scenes,
	all of which end in the dwarfs winning. North is a doorway, and south a
	low passage. To the west is a weapon store, which it appears the room
	is primarily designed to guard.
wpnstr
	Weapon store.
	All about you is the most horrifying assortment of weapons you care to
	envisage. Although they are too small for you to use in the main, the
	various iron maidens, thumbscrews and racks also present show that the
	dwarfs also use the room for torturing prisoners and each other. The
	only exit is to the east, into a guard room.
lowps7
	%lowps1
	You are stood in a low passage connecting two guard rooms, one to the
	north and one to the south. There is a doorway to the west which is
	of polished wood, and seems to be to somewhere very important.
guard3
	%guard1
	You are in a guard room, bedecked in fine war trophies, most of which
	are out of reach on the surprisingly high walls. The room is normally
	reached by a low passage to the north, but to the south is a doorway
	of very old oak, shined and polished to perfection. Obviously, it hides
	something regarded with importance.
minrm
	Ministerial room.
	This is the dwarfen parliament room, where the king's ministers debate
	the issues of the dwarfen realm. It is richly fashioned with oak
	fittings, designed to hold, say, ten or so dwarfs excluding the king
	himself. There is a doorway to the east, and a guard room to the south.
guard4
	%guard1
	This is the home of the king's guard, special, hand-picked troops of
	the highest order, pledged to lay their lives down in order to save that
	of their regal master. To the north is a room which seems to indicate
	use as a debating forum of some kind, and from it through this room runs
	a red fitted carpet to a doorway in the south wall. The doorway itself
	is of heavy oak, and although elegantly finished seems to be built more
	with strength in mind than ornamentation.
kingrm
	Throne room.
	This is the throne room, the very seat of power in the dwarfen realm.
	It is luxuriously carpeted, and the walls are painted gold. It is here
	that the dwarfen king holds audiences and receives oaths of fealty. The
	king's study is to the east, and southwest lies the royal bedroom. A
	doorway in the north wall is the only other exit.
kqdorm
	Royal bedroom.
	It is here that the dwarfen king and queen sleep. The room is furnished
	with the normal bedroom paraphenalia, all dwarf-sized however so not
	much good for you. The walls are a regal purple, and the floor is of
	a soft, mossy material. The only exit is to the throne room, northeast.
kingst
	King's study.
	You are stood in the room the dwarfen king uses for much of his work.
	A hollow cut out into the wall is obviously used for a desk, and it
	is built with comfort and practicality in mind. The throne room is
	easily accessed to the west, and there is a low passage to the south.
	North is a doorway, of exceptionally old oak, well-tended and polished.
lowps8
	%lowps1
	You are in a low passage, which curves from a study to the north to end
	in a doorway to the east.
ktreas
	King's treasure chamber.
	This room is built to house the crown jewels and other assorted
	treasures of the dwarfen realm. It is austere in itself, and the only
	way out is through a doorway to the west.
lowps6
	%lowps1
	You are in a low passage, which heads north to become the central
	leg of a T-junction, and runs south to end in a doorway. East, it
	opens up into a room.
dwrm2
	%dwrm1
	This is a room used by the dwarfs for everyday living, mainly by the
	females and children. There is a doorway to the north, and another
	room to the south. Northwest, there is an opening onto a guard room.
dwrm3
	%dwrm2
	You are stood in a very large room which the dwarfs use to manufacture
	most of their goods. Dotted about all over are dozens of machines of
	varying degrees of complexity, some so strange and old it is doubtful
	that any of the dwarfs even know what they do. There is a thick wooden
	door to the south, apparently for sound-proofing, and a low passage
	leads off to the west.
dwrm4
	%dwrm1
	You look about to find yourself in a room used mainly during the
	evenings and for relaxation. The older dwarfs are the kind you'd expect
	to find here, for it is surprisingly quiet and well furnished. There is
	another room to the north, and a low passage to the east. South you
	observe a doorway.
kdorm
	Children's dormitory.
	This is the room where the young dwarfs sleep. The walls are decorated
	in pictures of bunnies and pussies, and give the room a soft, dreamy
	effect. The parents' dormitory is to the east, and to the north is a
	door.
pdorm
	Married quarters.
	You are stood in the room in which live the married dwarfs. The various
	sub-rooms are discretely curtained off from each other, although the
	curtains are of course firmly fixed down to prevent their being stolen.
	The dormitory of their young is to the west, and northwards is a low
	passage.
lowps9
	%lowps1
	You are standing in a low passage, with three exits. West, the passage
	leads into a room; south it opens into a dormitory; north, it ends in
	a doorway.
odorm
	Officers' dormitory.
	This rather smart room is used as living quarters for officers and other
	high-ranking dwarfs. Its walls are painted mainly in portraits of dwarfs
	which all seem to look the same, due to their large beards. To the south
	is a doorway, and to the north the large dormitory of the lower dwarfs.
dorm
	Dormitory.
	This is a large room, wherein sleep most of the unmarried dwarfs. It is
	full of little hammocks upon which the dwarfs rest, sturdily fixed to
	the wall to prevent their theft. To the south is the more classy
	Officers' dormitory, and to the north is a heavy doorway, built to be
	sound-proof.
rail4	light
	Railway track.
	You are stood on a section of rusted railway line, which runs out
	from a tin mine in the base of a huge cliff to the east. Northwards
	is a paddock where the pit ponies used to be kept, and south east
	forest. Southwest is a mound, which the track cuts through as it
	continues to the west.
rail3	light
	%rail4
	You are stood on a section of east-west railway line, which continues
	in both directions. To the south is a mound through which the track
	is cutting, and to the north are a dale, and a paddock of some kind.
rail2	light
	%rail4
	This is an east-west railway track, running through some very pleasant
	surroundings. To the north and southwest are peaceful dales, and to the
	south lies a drowsy forest. A hillock to the southeast is cut through
	by the track as it heads east towards the base of a mighty cliff.
rail1	light
	%rail4
	This is the last section of a railway line. It continues to the east
	where it cuts through some dales, but to the west it stops at the
	beach. Northwards is a stony slope also leading to the beach, and to
	the southwest is a like slope, covered in scrubs.
stslop	light
	Stony slope.
	This is a slope running down from a dale in the east to a beach in the
	west. North is forest, and to the south is a section of railway line
	which runs east-west.
ndale	light
	North dale.
	You are stood in a quiet dale, at the foot of some gentle hills which
	rise drowsily to the north, their slopes drenched in the emerald colour
	of the trees which grow upon them. To the west the dale tails off into
	a stony slope reaching down to the shore, and east is a paddock of
	some description. To the south, before another forest, runs an east-
	west railway track.
paddck	light
	Paddock.
	This is a paddock, where once were kept the ponies which used to haul
	the heavy skips of tin from the mine down to the jetty on the beach.
	They have long since gone, but the railway line along which they used
	to toil is still intact, to the south. Westwards is a dale, and to
	northeast a ruin of some stone building. Eastwards, travel is impossible
	due to the enormous cliff which rises up into a mountain far into the
	clouds.
ruin	light
	Ruin.
	This conglomeration of stone which lies forlornly in the grass is all
	that is left of the outer buildings belonging to the nearby tinmine,
	before bad times fell upon it. Age and the weather have since reduced
	the once proud structures to moss-covered misshapen arrangements of
	rubble. To the north is a forest, and to the east an enormous cliff at
	the base of a huge, snow-capped mountain. Elsewhere is a pony paddock.

	You are stood in some dense forest, which slopes down to the south,
	where stones and masonry indicate once stood buildings, over which the
	forest has now extended.
beach3	light	nolook
	Stony beach.
	The beach upon which you are stood is covered in stones, a legacy of
	the days when mining material would fall from the skips of ore as they
	were loaded aboard merchantmen. To the north, the beach continues, and
	to the west is the sea. East is a slope covered in scrubs, which rises
	up to a dale. On the northern part of the beach can be seen a jetty.
	Southwards, however, a headland with high cliffs cuts off the way.
beach4	light	nolook
	%beach3
	This is a beach covered in stones of irregular size. To the north the
	cliffs rise, forming a cove which cuts off the area, but southwards
	the beach continues. A railway line runs from the east, and to the
	west a jetty forces itself out into the waves. To the southeast and
	northeast, slopes rise up into dales.
shrine	light	small
	Shrine.
	You are inside a small yet sacrosanct shrine. A sense of deep
	respectfulness fills this modest room. The way out, into a pine forest,
	is to the northwest. It is obvious that the shrine was meant to be used
	for quiet meditation, like similar chambers.
osanct	light	small	silent
	Outer sanctum.
	You find yourself in the outer sanctum of some strange, holy temple.
	All about you, the walls seem to be a hazy, formless blackness, but
	there is a visible opening to the north from whence comes an errie,
	golden light.
isanct	light	small	silent
	Inner sanctum.
	This is the inner sanctum of a most reverend shrine. Thousands of
	years it has existed, with only the highest of high priests permitted to
	enter this hallowed room. The walls are a strange, misty black, and
	golden light comes from an indeterminate source high above. An opening
	to the south leads to the outer sanctum, but the bizarre walls may lead
	elsewhere, too...
jetty	light
	Jetty.
	This is a wooden jetty, which forces itself out into the sea. To the
	east is the beach, but otherwise all around is the sea.
hdland	light
	Headland.
	This is a small headland, jutting out of the island in a southeasterly
	direction. All around the peninsula is rough sea, except to the
	northwest, where a thicket is situated, and northwards where is a
	sandy cove.
cove	light
	Cove.
	You are stood in a sandy, windswept cove to the east of the island.
	South is a barren headland, and southwest a thicket. To the north is
	forest, and to the northwest a clearing, near which the indigenous
	birds of the island refuse to fly. Eastwards is the rough sea.
ifrst1	light
	Arcane forest.
	You are stood in the awful hideousness of an arcane forest, its trees
	misshapen collections of charred and splintered branches. All around
	to the west rages the savage sea, and to the north the forest
	continues. Eastwards, it has been cleared where it becomes a steep
	slope.
ifrst2	light
	%ifrst1
	This ancient forest in which you are stood looks to have been laid
	to waste millennia ago, by some immense fire-breathing creation of the
	evil gods. To the west, the relentless bombardment of the sea
	continues, and to the east is a steep slope. South, the forest
	is the same, but northwards it becomes foliated again.
ifrst3	light
	Oak forest.
	This is a forest of oak trees, in the northwest corner of the island.
	To the south the forest has been ravaged by some diabolic evil, and
	to the east is normal forest sloping upwards. West and north, the
	rough sea batters away at the rugged coastline.
ifrst4	light
	Sloping forest.
	This is a sparse forest, which slopes from the south upwards to the
	north. At the south end is a cove, which meets the rough sea that
	is to the east. Southwest is an evil place, where such wildlife as
	inhabits the island does not dare travel. To the west the forest
	clears, and to the north is a clearing, upon which you can see a
	ring of huge stones.
ifrst6	light
	%ifrst4
	This is a forest on a steep hill, leading from an oak forest to the
	west upwards to a clearing containing a huge ring of stones to the
	north. Southwards the trees also end, and to the north the rough
	sea crashes against the island.
ifrst5	light
	Thicket.
	This is a thicket, straddling the island. To the southeast it isolates
	a barren headland, and to the east is a windswept cove. West is
	wilderness which slopes up northwards, and to the north is level
	ground, but over which hangs an aura of intense danger.
slope1	light
	Steep slope.
	This is a steep slope, running upwards to the north. Beyond more
	slopes, at the top of the rock, a huge ring of stones can be seen,
	a scene which dominates the whole island. To the east is a thicket, and
	to the west an arcane forest. Southwards, the slope meets the sea in
	a bay which looks just about calm enough to sail a small craft.
fring	light	nolook
	Fairy ring.
	You are stood in a desolate spot. The only noise is the howling wind
	as it comes off the sea beyond a cove to the southeast. In the
	centre of this wilderness is a fairy ring, a circle etched out by
	toadstools many centuries before. No animals or birds of the island
	will go in the area, although it it large enough for a human to enter.
	North and west are slopes leading upwards to a plateau at the top of the
	rock of an island, and northeast is forest.
slope2	light
	%slope1
	You are stood on a steep slope, leading upwards to the north. At the
	top, there levels out a plateau on the top of the rock which is this
	island. East is forest, south and west more wilderness.

	This is a stretch of wilderness sloping upwards to the east onto a
	plateau surmounted by a druidic ring of stones. North is s forest,
	and west the slope levels out into a forest of oak.
rost	light
	Ring of stones.
	You find yourself overawed by the huge ring of stones which encircle
	this, the highest part of the island rock. As the wind sweeps over from
	the rugged cliffs to the east and north, the whistling is broken only
	by the lonely cries of the ravens which hover above. To the south and
	west are steep slopes downwards. Far, far away in the distance on the
	southeast horizon can be glimpsed the sail of a wrecked ship. In the
	centre of the ring of stones is a large, heavy, bloodstained, slate,
	sacrificial slab. Many people have been killed here.
brost	light
	Beneath ring of stones.
	You are underneath the ring of stones, in a druidic chamber not entered
	these past two thousand years until today. Light comes from the way out,
	which is above. The walls of the chamber are stained red with the blood
	from the sacrifices above. Steps lead down to the southwest.
dtest1	light	nolook
	Steps down.
	As you go down, an axe swings out from above, but with a swish of your
	magic sword you deflect it to one side. The way from here is a
	downward climb, which you won't be able to climb back up, or the way
	you came from the steps to the northeast. The floor is carpeted in a
	heavy mist, so you cannot see your feet.
dtest2	light	nolook
	Niche room.
	You start your descent, and the rocky walls change into clayy earth.
	Suddenly, a clod comes loose from a tricky section, and you fall back.
	With amazing speed you hook out with your sickle and it digs into the
	wall, saving you from falling. You get to the bottom safely. There is
	no exit, only a niche in the wall, to put things into. The floor is
	covered in mist.
dtest3	light	nolook
	Druid room.
	This most ancient of rooms is the old temple of the druids who once
	lived upon this island. It is bare, the druids having taken their
	paraphenalia with them when they fled The Land. Written onto the
	wall in blue daub reads, "With the fork of gold eat the sprig of
	pearls." There is a doorway to the north, and no apparent light
	source although the room is illuminated.
dtreas	light	nolook
	Druidical treasure chamber.
	The room in which you find yourself is the most wonderous you have
	ever glimpsed, its walls impregnated with starstones and the air
	thickly scented with the drowsy aromatic sweetness of mistletoe.
	The way out is via a rectangular hole in the roof.
dead20	light	death
	An unseen strong current suddenly drags hold of your little craft and
	sucks it underwater. You splash about, but eventually drown. Sigh.
vrocks	light
	Vicious rocks.
	You are landed by some vicious rocks out at sea. A strong current
	flows past at alarming speed round the tattered, half-submerged
	wreckage of a galleon stuck forlornly on them. You can cross to the
	deck of the ship by going northwards, but its front half is underwater.
	To the east in the distance can be seen a beach and cliff. Quite a way
	to the south there looks to be a small island, dominated by a huge
	archway which stands astride it.
deck	light
	Deck.
	You are stood on the deck of a wrecked galleon. To the south are some
	vicious rocks. Upwards, the main mast, still unbroken, leads to the
	crow's nest; to the east are steps to the poop deck, and to the
	northeast is the Captain's cabin. Downwards is the hold.
crow	light	small
	Crow's nest.
	You are perched in the crow's nest, high above the sea where it juts
	out from the deck below. Far, far to the northwest can be glimpsed a
	mysterious island, and to the east over the sea are cliffs.

	You are on some shakey steps leading from the deck upwards to the poop.
poop	light
	Poop deck.
	You are on the poop deck of the wrecked galleon. Westwards, steps lead
	down to the deck. The wheel of the ship is stiffened and will not move
	an inch. A name carved into it reads, "H.M.S. Essex".
capt	light
	Captain's cabin.
	This cabin was once occupied by the captain of the ship. Most of the
	contents have been washed away, and all that remains is driftwood. To
	the southwest is an opening leading to the deck, and a hole in the
	floor leads downwards to the galley.
galley	light	nolook
	Galley.
	This used to be the kitchen of the galleon, but all the utensils have
	been washed away. A hole in the floor leads to the powder room, and
	one in the roof leads to the captain's cabin.
proom	light
	Powder room.
	The smell of sulphur fills the air as you look around you in the
	storage place for gunpowder. Most of the kegs have been broken by the
	elements, and are now useless. There was a way down but it is flooded.
	Upwards is an opening in the ceiling to the galley.
hold	light
	Hold.
	This is what remains of the hold which is unflooded. The walls are
	stained black with the pitch used for waterproofing. The only
	exit is upwards to the deck.
dead23	light	death
	You enter the powder room, and smell sulphurous fumes just before
	igniting the powder ingrained in the wooden walls, and blowing
	yourself to kingdom come. At least you went with a bang!
bwfall	small	light	nolook
	Behind waterfall.
	You are in a small room behind a thundering waterfall. Above and
	around you is a mighty cliff, and the walls of the cave glitter as
	they catch the fractured light from outside. A spiral staircase to
	the east leads upwards into the rock.
spiral	small
	Spiral staircase.
	This is a spiral staircase, carved into the rock. Above, the steps
	stop and a vertical section of steps follows. Below can be heard a
	thundering crescendo of noise, and the sea can be smelled.
vert	small	dmove	spiral
	Vertical staircase.
	This is a tight vertical climb, the steps hewn into the rocks in a
	ladder-like arrangement. Above is a small room whence a hum ensues,
	and below is a spiral staircase leading downwards.
revrm	small
	Reverberating room.
	The walls around you in this small, oval room are humming as the
	crashing of the waterfall outside resonates through the cliff. The
	way out is a vertical climb leading downwards to the west, and another
	passage runs northwards on the same level.
revps	small	light
	Reverberating passage.
	This passage also reverberates with the crashing of the waterfall
	outside, but not so much as the reverberating room to the south.
	Light comes from an opening onto a room to the north.
grotto	light
	Grotto.
	This is a grotto, high up in the cliffs, but concealed from the beach by
	an overhang. Out to sea can be seen a wrecked ship, tossed by some
	fearful storm onto a pincushion of vicious rocks. Above is the cliff.
fossrm	small
	Fossil room.
	This ancient room has not been visited in centuries until this day. Its
	walls are studded with ancient fossils of creatues belonging to a bygone
	era. An eerie sense of awe and wonder permeates the timeless cave.
fortun	light
	Forbidding tunnel.
	You are in a forbidding tunnel underneath a mighty cliff. Light comes
	from the western end, from which can also be heard the sound of the
	sea. At the eastern end the rock becomes harder and the sea has not
	eroded it. However, there are support braces for a heavy iron grate
	there, in the roof.
smuggl
	Smugglers' cave.
	The irregularily-shaped room in which you find yourself is an old
	cave, initially opened up by the sea but since enlarged upon by man.
	Years ago, it was used as a hiding place by smugglers. In the floor
	is a heavy iron grate, and below is a forbidding tunnel.
oglair
	Ogre's lair.
	This is a large room used as a home by an ogre. The floor is littered
	with the bones of the dead, licked clean by the monster. A dark passage
	exits to the north, and there is a small opening to the south. The
	smell in the room is reminiscent of animals, and of the grave...

	you leaped you might have decided not to jump!
outhut	light
	In front of hut.
	You are standing in front of a ramshackle hut. Behind you is a field
	of gorse. Further on to the south you can see a fast flowing river.
	To the east you can see a range of mountains wreathed in mist and
	to the west is a small cottage.
root	light
	Root room.
	You are in a room of tangled yew roots. There appears to be a passable
	gap to the north from whence emanates a dim light; to the south has
	been hewn a smooth tunnel. Light comes from a hollow tree stump above.
rtun1	light
	Root tunnel.
	You are in an underground tunnel, with dry roots hanging from the
	walls, and littering the floor. As you walk, you feel the twigs
	snapping under your feet. The tunnel runs north to south, with a
	dim light coming from the northern end, and a room of roots to the
	south.
rtun2	light
	Northern part of root tunnel.
	You are in the northern part of a subterranean tunnel, its walls and
	ceiling a mass of dangling, dry root from the tree above. There is a
	dim light to the north, where the tunnel opens up. To the south, the
	tunnel continues.
ydead1	light	death
	As you push your way through the hanging roots, the tinder dry wood
	catches fire from your burning torch. The flames leap rapidly from
	root to root, and soon you are surrounded by a raging fire. You feel
	your body charring as you fall to the ground in utter agony...
dead10	light	death
	When you drop your torch, the tinder dry wood ignites from the
	flame and an instant later you are burned to a frazzle as the
	sparks flash across the roots. Serves you right for playing with
	fire...
altar	light
	Sacred room.
	You are standing in a room faced with smooth marble. The central
	feature is a large, immobile block, out of which springs a tall flame,
	throwing the empty corners of the room into vague, flickering shadow.
	To the east is a dark tunnel, and to the south the only other entrance.
antech	small	light
	Ante chamber.
	You are standing in a small chamber carved out of the earth. To the
	west is a tunnel, out of which emanates a dim glow. A mysterious
	doorway is to the east, painted in a deep crimson colour.
hchamb
	Hallowed chamber.
	This is a sanctified, hallowed chamber, set off from the main temple by
	an opening to the south. A faint smell of bitter incense still hangs
	silently in the cold air. Most of the treasures which were once to be
	found here have been stolen.
temple
	Temple.
	You are in a silent, sinister temple, its walls and a doorway to the
	west painted in a deep crimson colour. The scent of stale incense
	still lingers on, although the temple has remained unused for some
	time and most of its trappings have been removed. A sliding chute
	leads down to here from the east, but it is impossible to ascend.
	In the north wall is an opening to a small chamber.
tunnel
	Earth tunnel.
	Before you is a convoluted earth tunnel. It seems to have been made
	by a gang of cheery dwarves. Then again it might not have been. The
	only exits appear to be to the north and southeast.
lgrm
	Large room.
	This is a very large room, at least 60 feet in diameter and some 20
	feet high. There are no apparent doors, but the walls are so full of
	nooks and crannies that you might be able to go in any direction if
	you tried. The only obvious exit is to the northwest.
wolfrm
	Wolf room.
	The evil stench of death hangs heavy on the wind in this most noxious
	of rooms. The walls and floor are coated with the crusted excrement of
	some massive hound, including the bones of brave men, licked clean
	in some ghastly display of macabre carnage. There is an exit to the
	west, and a deathly passage leading down...
deathp
	Deathly passage.
	This passage carries the scent of death, as it slants down from the
	west to deep underground at the east. A stream of dried blood meanders
	from the room at the top, and at the bottom the passage levels off.
cinder	nolook
	Cindered room.
	The floor on which you stand is deep in cinders, and its walls are
	blackened with soot from some incredible fire which must have once
	raged here in some lost time. The walls beneath the soot are
	glass-like, fused together by the radiant energy of the inferno.
	To the west is a passage leading upwards, and to the east a strange
	portal...
diamnd	nolook
	Diamond room.
	When you enter the room, you feel a sudden sense of change around
	you, although you cannot pinpoint the exact reason behind the
	instinct. You soon forget this, however, as your eyes catch sight
	of the floor: it is studded with diamonds! You leap down to pick them
	up, but most are solidly fused in place. Looking around you, you see
	a deathly passage sloping upwards to the west, and a strange doorway
	to the east...
firept	light	hideaway
	Fiery pit.
	A narrow ledge here is the only safe place to tread, as a bubbling
	pit of fiery tar and sulphur is on either side. The only exit is to
	the west, into a passage still heated by the flames from the pit.
	Breathing is difficult, but you can still get enough oxygen, albeit
	with discomfort.
estlpl
	East side of still pool room.
	You are in a vaguely circular room with a high ceiling. The
	way west is interposed by a large pool, but east is a hole in the wall.
wstlpl
	West side of still pool room.
	You are on the west side of the still pool room. There appear to
	be no exits.
tombrm
	Tomb room.
	Above you, a set of narrow stairs lead upwards out of the tomb. To the
	south is a scraped-out passage, above which is scrawled in crimson,
	"EMERALD AND RED HAVE VALUE". The rest of the walls appear devoid of any
	markings and there appears to be no other exit apart from the passage to
	the south.
rottrm
	Rotting room.
	You are in a room of badly hollowed-out earth. The floor is littered
	with rotting debris as if some evil feast of saphrophitic carnage
	had been interrupted by your arrival. The only ways out from this
	foul-smelling hole seem to be to the west and north.
cavein
	Caved-in grave.
	You are underneath a caved-in grave, although there is no way up
	to the surface from here. Most of the corpse from the grave appears
	to have been devoured so perhaps the cave-in was no accident...
	To the west is a small chute which leads downwards, but you won't
	be able to come back if you take it, or carry anything with you.
befgte	light
	Before Gate.
	You are standing in front of a huge oaken gate, rotted through over
	the ages so passage is easy. To the north is a narrow ledge over a deep
	pit, and to the south a dark passage whence drifts the scent of animals.
	The scene is visible by light beyond a smallish hole in the west wall.
	You can travel through the gate, to the east.
bef1
	Before idol.
	You are stood in front of a huge idol of a cyclops, hewn into the
	rock face and towering above you. To the west is a large doorway but
	the door has long since rotted away. Stairs run up the side of the idol
	to an opening at the mouth, and beyond. To the north is a small opening.
crypt
	Ancient crypt.
	As you crawl out through the room, a sense of reverence comes over you,
	for you find you are in a crypt. It has obviously not been entered for
	a long time, and is stark and sparse save for a marble block in the
	centre of the room, which is immobile.
ydead5	light	death
	As you leap, you suddenly realise that you are about to be splattered
	all over the floor. Sure enough, you are.
ydead4	light	death
	As you start to cross the narrow ledge, the ox, nervous because of the
	tremendous drop, is reluctant to follow and gives you a nudge with
	its nose. You are knocked off balance and plummet downwards, breaking
	into little pieces when you finally hit the bottom.
saltar	small
	Small altar room.
	You are in a small room with an altar in front of you. Apart from the
	narrow ledge there is no way out.
mthidl
	Outside mouth of idol.
	You are stood by the mouth of a large and ancient idol of a cyclops.
	To the west, lower down, can be seen a tall but rotted gate. Above
	are the nose and eye of the colossus.
inmth
	Inside mouth of idol.
	You are stood in the opening at the mouth of the idol. The walls are
	blacked with the incense of ages passed. An opening to the east leads
	deeper into the rock, whereas the mouth of the idol is to the west.
hollow
	Hollowed-out passage.
	This is an east-west passage, carved through the granite of the
	mountain. At the west end is an opening to a small room, and at
	the east a junction with some roughly hewn steps going downwards,
	and the rest of the passage. The steps downwards curve away to the left.
rsteps
	Roughly hewn steps.
	You are on a spiral staircase, curving downwards into the bowels
	of the mountain. The walls are solid rock, and the staircase is
	narrow.
Rockps
	Rock passage.
	This is a passage carved into the rock, running east-west. At the
	west end the passage continues, and makes a junction with some
	steps leading downwards. At the east end the passage opens into
	a chamber of some description.
chambr
	Ancient chamber.
	This is a ghostly chamber, its aged walls decorated with strange
	glyphs and ancient runes which you cannot understand. To the west
	is an opening to a passage. The eerie shadows cast by your light
	add to the feeling of time and wonder you sense around you.
uland1
	Staircase landing.
	You are stood in a small open area, which makes a junction a spiral
	staircase leading both up and down. The steps down are much more
	worn than those up, and the landing shows signs of recent use. To
	the north is a battle-scarred oaken doorway.
guadrm
	Guard room.
	You are in a plain room of sanded granite, with seats set into the
	wall which are well worn. To the south is an oaken doorway.
wstep1
	Worn steps.
	You are on a worn spiral staircase leading both up and down.
wstep2
	%wstep1
	You are on a worn spiral staircase leading both up and down.
wstep3
	%wstep1
	You are on a worn spiral staircase leading both up and down.
uland2
	Bottom of worn steps.
	You have reached the bottom of some worn steps, and find yourself in
	a roughly-made room. The steps lead upwards, and to the west is an
	exit to a natural cavern.
natcav
	Natural Cavern.
	This is a large natural cavern, caused by fissures in the rocks eons
	ago. There is a well-worn path leading east-west, although the
	cavern is bedded with granite. At the east end are steps to a landing;
	at the west the cavern joins a north-south passage.
passg1
	Passage.
	You are in a narrow, north-south passage which continues in both
	directions. To the west is a doorway, and to the east is an entrance
	to a natural cavern.

	This is a narrow east-west passage, with a doorway at the west and and
	an opening to a room at the east.
passg9
	%passg1
	You are in a narrow east-west passage. To the east are steps leading
	upwards, and to the west the passage curves away to the left as you
	look at it. In the north wall is a doorway.
pass10
	%passg1
	This is a narrow stretch of passage running east-west. At the east end
	it joins a crooked passage, and at the west it stops. There is an
	opening in the north wall at the west end leading to a long passage, and
	one in the south wall at the west end leading into a room.
gob1
	Goblin lair.
	This is a filthy room, vaguely square, with a doorway in the south wall
	and an opening to a passage in the west.
gob2
	%gob1
	This is a filthy room, roughly square-shaped, with a doorway on the
	west wall and openings to passages in the north, east and south.
gob3
	%gob1
	This dirty room is roughly square-shaped, with a doorway on the north
	wall and an opening to a passage on the east.
gob4
	%gob1
	This is an unclean room, rectangular in shape, with an opening to the
	south and a doorway to the north. There doesn't appear to be any way
	of opening or unlocking the door from this side.
gob5
	%gob1
	This disgusting room is square-shaped. In the east wall is a doorway,
	and to the south is an opening to a passage. There is a steep chute
	in the north wall, leading down, but if taken you won't be able to
	get back up through it.
treasc
	Treasure chamber.
	You find yourself in a room decked out in all manner of fabulous
	valuables hoarded by the goblins over the years. Most of them,
	however, are fabulous only in the eyes of goblins and there mightn't
	be any you'd consider as treasure yourself. To the south in this room
	is a doorway, and there is also a chute leading upwards, but it's
	impossible to ascend.
ewstep
	East-west steps.
	You are on a staircase running down to the west and up to the east. At
	the top is a room, at the bottom a passage.
curve
	Curved passage.
	This is a semi-circular passage, which bends to the east onto a passage
	at the north end, and to the northeast onto a diagonal passage at the
	southernmost end. If looked at from above, with north at the top and
	south at the bottom, it could be described as the left half of a circle.
diagps
	Diagonal passage.
	This is a narrow passage, running diagonally from the southwest to the
	northeast. At the southwest end, it comes onto a passage which curves
	away to the right, and at the northeast end is space for a vertically
	sliding panel.
spanel
	Sliding panel room.
	In this room you find space for a vertically sliding panel in the east
	wall, but apart from that there are no interesting features. The only
	exit is to the west where steps lead downwards. The place where the
	panel goes has solid rock behind it.
bluerm	small
	Blue room.
	This is a smallish room, painted in a bright royal blue for some reason,
	from the ceiling to the floor. The way out is to the southwest, behind
	where a vertically sliding panel is obviously intended to go.
longps
	Long passage.
	You are in a long, narrow, north-south passage. At the north end it
	goes into a room, at the south it joins a crooked passage running
	east-west.
crookp
	Crooked passage.
	This is a crooked passage running essentially east-west. At the west
	end it straightens out, and at the east are narrow steps leading down.
	There is an opening in the north wall leading onto a long passage.
nstep1	small
	Narrow steps.
	You are on some narrow steps, running a long way downwards from west to
	east.
nstep2	small
	%nstep1
	You are on some narrow steps, running up from east to west. The steps
	are old, and look rarely used.
nstep3	small
	%nstep1
	You are on some narrow steps, running up from east to west. The steps
	are old, and look rarely used.
uland3
	Bottom of stairs.
	You are in a small landing, deep in the bowels of the earth. The only
	way out looks to be by some steps at the west end which run upwards. In
	the northwest corner of this oval-shaped room is a widish, polished
	chute, but it runs upwards and is slippery, so you cannot take it. Don't
	know why I bothered mentioning it, actually!
lsp1
	Long sloping passage.
	This is a long, sloping passage, running from the south upwards to the
	north, with openings at both ends.
lsp2
	%lsp1
	This is a long, sloping passage, running from the south upwards to the
	north, with openings at both ends.
lsp3
	%lsp1
	This is a long, sloping passage, running from the south upwards to the
	north, where can be seen a dim light.
river3	light
	Underground river.
	You are on the banks of a fast-flowing river. High above is an opening
	in the mountain, whence comes daylight, but it is impossible to reach
	it. The river flows east-west, but underground at either end so you
	cannot follow it. There is a slight bank to the north of you, and a
	passage sloping downwards to the south.
nbank	small	light
	North bank of underground river.
	This is the north bank of the river, and is slightly muddy but not bad
	enough to make you slip. Light comes from the opening high above.
cannrm
	Cannon room.
	You are in a square-shaped room. To the north is an opening onto a
	passage, and to the south is a doorway. In the room, facing the
	doorway, is an old ship's cannon.
fowrm	light	small
	Fountain room.
	An unmistakable sense of magic pervades this small room. In one corner
	is a marvellous fountain, sprinkling sparkling water 6 feet into the
	air. To the north is an opening to a larger room, but there are no
	other exits.
eyedol	small
	Nose and eye of idol.
	You are at the top of the idol. The stairs go no further.
attic	light
	Attic.
	This is attic, or the loft. Dust of ages past lies here, barely
	disturbed for generations. The thatched roof of the cottage adds
	to the generally musty smell, and sense of mystery and excitement.
	You can see because a thinning section of thatch lets the light in.
cuptop	nolook
	Top of cupboard.
	You are stood at the top of the ladder in the cupboard. The walls
	are old and the plaster is cracking, especially at the join with
	the cupboard's ceiling. The ladder is very firm and steady.
dead11	light	death
	The cupboard is very small, and as you ascend the ladder you suddenly
	realise that you are running out of air! Try as you might, you cannot
	break your way out of the place, although you bash at all the walls,
	and the ceiling and floor. Eventually you suffocate. Now you know how
	the scratch marks on the wall were made!
laddrm	light	small	dmove	uhut
	Ladder Shaft.
	You are on a ladder, halfway between a hut and an underground room
	dug into the earth. The inside of the hut can be observed through
	holes in the floorboard, and it appears to have walls decorated with
	animal trophies and other assorted items.
uhut
	Underground Room.
	This is an underground room, once used as a den by some forester,
	perhaps. Its floor is covered with a soft moss, and it is surprisingly
	comfortable, with evidence of once having an easy chair, and a fire
	underneath a shaft (for ventilation). The shaft leads upwards and
	contains a ladder affixed to the walls. To the west is a very small
	tunnel, which you can squeeze into but won't be able to turn in.
stun1	small
	Small tunnel.
	You are in a small, claustrophobic, earthen tunnel, curving from the
	north to the east.

dsteps	light
	Steps to cellar.
	You are on some granite steps leading downwards to the cellar. There
	is a hallway above to the northeast, and below is a dank cellar.
cellar	light
	Cellar.
	This is a dank, murky cellar, its granite-faced walls stained with
	mould and dust. Upwards to the northeast are steps, whence comes
	light enough to see by. To the south is a crack in the wall, leading
	to a small, earthen tunnel, although it looks very cramped and you
	might not be able to turn round and come back were you to enter it.
	To the west is the doorway to the coal bunker.
dead15	light	death
	As you attempt to move in a direction other than along the passage,
	the soft earthen wall starts to crumble. You try to pack it back,
	but the effect increases until the whole tunnel is falling about
	your ears. Desperately, you claw your way through the disintigrating
	passage, but the roof caves down and you are trapped, buried alive
	under the huge weight of soil. A terrible way to go...
dead16	light	death
	You smash yourself into the rocks below and are consequently killed.
sloptn	small
	Sloping tunnel.
	This is a small tunnel sloping from the north down to the south. Its
	walls are earthy but hardened, and only about two feet apart.
level
	Level room.
	The floor of this square-shaped room lies on bedrock, and has been
	chiselled painstakingly so as to be perfectly level. To the north is
	a narrow passage, sloping upwards, and to the south is a short flight
	of steps leading down to a muddy room.
mudrm
	Mud room.
	In this room, a large amount of reddish mud lies on the floor. The
	floor is otherwise of unchiselled bedrock. A short flight of steps
	to the north leads upwards into a square room with a level floor.
schamb
	Small chamber.
	You are in a small chamber with dry, earthy walls. The only exit is
	to the west where you can see a room, its floor is deep in reddish mud.
hotpas	light
	Hot passage.
	You are in a hot passage running east-west. At the west end is a
	strange doorway, and at the east is a fiery pit, which makes the
	atmosphere clammy, and thick with sulphurous fumes.
dead19	light	death
	Kingdom come.
	You find yourself blown to kingdom come. Not really the ideal place
	to spend the rest of your life, especially when you're dead. Next
	time you'll know to put a fuse in and blast with the keg instead of
	trying to burn it...
dead27	light	death
	The ox, afraid of the thundering waterfall, nudges you with its snout
	as you walk under. You trip, and are drowned by the waters, held
	underneath the surface by the falling torrent. Glug glug.
dead28	light	death
	The die comes up one. For an instant, it seems to glow a hellish red,
	then there is an ear-splitting crack, as if the very fabric of the
	universe had been rent. The die explodes into uncountable shards, and
	you are killed by the blast. The goddess of luck must really dislike
	you...
dead29	light	death
	Mistletoe is poisonous, simpleton! Don't you know ANYTHING?
dead30	light	death
	You try to set sail, but the seas are much rougher than you had
	anticipated. Desperately, you try to make your way back to the shore,
	realising that death is inevitable. You are right, and inevitably die.
dead31	light	death
	Off you jump, safe in the knowledge that your pseudo-parachute will
	save you from certain death. Unfortunately, the strong winds coming
	off the sea blow it out of your hands! Guess what happens next..?
dead33	light	death
	You poison yourself, simpleton.
dead34	light	death
	You start to move, and suddenly the squirrels start acting very
	viciously. They scamper about you scratching and clawing, then, as
	one, they leap at you and start gnawing at your flesh with their
	sharp incisors. You try to beat them off, but they are too many and
	are incensed by something into a maddened rage. Eventually you are
	torn to pieces. I wonder what it is you did? Or didn't do?
dead37	light	death
	>-KABOOM-<
dead39	light	death
	You walk out of the coal bunker, but the coal dust by the door ignites
	from your brand, and an instant later you find you aren't.
dead40	light	death
	All of a sudden the lit torch you are carrying sets fire to your boat,
	and within seconds the wood is in flames. You look about in horror as
	your little craft burns to nothing before your very eyes. Glug glug ()
	glug ().
dead41	light	death
	All of a sudden, from out of nowhere, comes a wall of water, crashing
	towards you with immense power! You are hopelessly trapped, and although
	you try your best you've no time to react. To cut a long story short,
	you get buffeted against the floor and pounded to death. And if you'd
	have survived that you'd have drowned, too...
dead43	light	death
	You leap off, hoping that for some reason you won't kill yourself
	when you land. Where you got that idea from I'll NEVER know...

15	*HINTS:
	 If you want to see underground, light a stick from a fire.
	 If you want to score points for treasure, drop it in the swamp.
	 The swamp can be found by typing SWAMP outside until you reach it.
	 OUT normally moves you in the direction of the start.
	 If you're carrying a lit stick, look out for marsh gas.
	 Just type the answers to the mausoleum questions straight, eg 45.
	 Brollies make good parachutes.
	 Dryads are combustible.
	 The shrine, hallowed chamber and ancient chamber are good places in
		which to meditate.
	 Beggars deserve to be kicked.
	If you think these hints can be improved, type SUGGESTION and say
	what you think's wrong.
50	The door's shut, can't you see you berk?
51	The forest becomes too dense to go any farther. You give up and turn
	back.
52	As you approach the edge of the cliff the rock starts to crumble.
	Hurriedly you retreat as you feel the ground begin to give way under
	your feet!
53	You can't fit through that small serving hatch!
54	There's a whopping great big stone wall in the way!
55	The water here is flowing too fast for you to ford the river safely.
60	The barrel is too wide to fit through the opening.
61	The barrel upturns and smashes, but its contents have mysteriously
	disappeared...
62	The reddish water splooshes out of the barrel as you drop the thing,
	but seeps into the earthy walls at an alarming rate, and is soon gone.
	Very little goes down the steps.
63	The water splooshes out of the barrel when you let it go, and laps up
	against the porous walls. You suddenly become witness to an incredible
	sight as the dry mud absorbs the water incredibly quickly, and falls
	off to join the general mud on the floor. A short while later, a small
	chamber to the east can be seen which was previously obscured by its
	bizarre covering.
64	The barrel's smashed remains crash loudly to the floor.
65	The east wall sounds hollow.
66	The mud is incredibly hard, as if baked on, and will not yield to any
	of your attempts at breaking it.
69	The mud is too gooey to carry around. It's useless even if you could!
70	The gooey mud makes a squelching sound...
71	The dryad wails in agony as your axe bites deep into its trunk, and
	flails its branches around desperately trying to keep you off. Your
	chop, however, was sufficient to finish it, and it crashes to the
	ground and disappears whence it came.
72	The dryad instantly falls back, but too late and your torch takes
	hold. A few seconds later, all that remains is the smouldering ash
	that once was alive, then this, too, disappears whence it came.
73	The climb is too tight and precarious for you to be able to drop
	anything here.
74	The conch emits a low reverberation, but it's not very loud.
75	The conch emits a low reverberation, which resonates with the
	sound of the waterfall. As you blow harder, it gets louder until
	it becomes almost deafening, then suddenly there is a tremendous
	> CRACK < and the east wall of the room splits apart to reveal
	a dark, eerie room.
76	The conch emits a low, but loud, reverberation.
77	From the end of your wand leaps a particularly vicious bolt of
	vivid green lightning, which strikes the dryad with a hollow crack.
	A trice later, and nothing remains of the unfortunate creature...
78	The beggar senses that you are about to zap him and leaps up to
	defend himself. However, the electric glow which dances from the
	end of your wand soon puts an end to his wretched life, and his
	smouldering rags are the last evidence of his time in the Land...
79	The tomb is too stiff to open directly.
80	With your combined strength, the grate slides open.
81	The grate is already open, dunderhead!
82	Pushing and heaving together, you slide the grate shut.
83	It's already shut! Take a look if you don't believe me!
84	The grate is too difficult to open or close alone, get someone to help
	you.
85	The grate is slid closed, try opening it...
86	Ughhh...
87	From the end of your rod flashes a scarlet ray of immense power. You
	shield your eyes from the incredible intensity, and when you next
	look, the tree has been felled.
89	The door is too strong to break, even when you use the weapon.
102	You wave the rattle to and fro and it makes a rattling noise!
104	With a great deal of effort you make the bed.
105	Chop, chop, chop . . . >creak<  >groan< . . . >crack<
	"TIMBERRRRRRRRRR" with a tremendous >CRASH< the aged tree falls
	majestically to the ground. As the dust settles you notice that the
	stump of the Yew is hollow, but the shadows are too deep for you to
	see far down the hole. It looks descendable though...
106	A hollow sound reverberates from the trunk of the tree.
107	OK, it's unfurled.
108	OK, it's furled.
111	With the most earshattering squealling and groaning the top of the
	tomb slides to one side. Revealing a staircase..
112	The tomb is already open, stupid!
113	The tomb shows no signs of activity.
114	The ground is too hard for the swamp to swallow you up here.
120	The weather has swollen the river and you cannot cross!
116	You can't climb bushy trees like yews! Maybe you could from INSIDE...
117	The ox mechanistically lows a loud "MOO".
118	The beggar moans as your foot smashes into his face.
119	The beggar wants people to feed him with food, not make token gifts
	of paltry goods the wretch finds useless.
167	The beggar eagerly accepts your food, then drops it in astonishment as
	the individual potatoes turn to gold in his hands! "Praise the gods, a
	miracle!" you think, hastily pushing the beggar out of the way and
	collecting the treasure. "I preferred them before," thinks the beggar,
	sorrowfully.
121	The ox is dead.
122	The ox isn't hungry, it just wants a bit of love.
123	Oxen are renowned for their dislike of suspicious herbs...
124	The eye loosens in its socket and tumbles out.
125	The gods don't appear to be listening.
126	With a great deal of fun you unmake the bed.
127	A dazzling ray sparks in a multitude of brilliant colours from the
	end of your wand, and the door is blasted to oblivion. The doorway
	itself is now passable.
128	Everything around you grows hazy, and merges into a swirling display
	of magical colours and shapes, and you feel your wand slip from your
	hand. Suddenly, the vivid chromatic opaqueness clears, and you
	re-materialise...
129	Just because there's a window there, it doesn't mean you have to go
	jump out of it, clod!
130	It was a very old ox and hadn't long to live anyway.
133	It's already dead you steaming great nit!
134	The ox isn't in a condition to eat at the moment...
135	The tree won't chop any further. Sorry if you were trying to make
	brands out of it, but it wouldn't burn anyway (it may be hollow, but
	it's still got lots of resin in it).
136	chop, chop, chop . . . >creak<  >groan< . . .
137	The tree is felled so climbing it is rather pointless...
138	The pool starts freezing over the instant your icicles make contact.
	As it hardens, it expands, but not enough to do any damage. The way
	across is now safe.
140	In these parts, it is too dangerous to swim in flowing water. A more
	likely place would be a pool, perhaps underground.
141	Worship in these parts is customarily conducted near idols, usually
	their eyes if there are precious stones there.
142	This is a MASSIVE idol! Worshipping it from here isn't good enough! Go
	up the steps you buffoon!
143	THE STAIRS GO NO FURTHER! Read the description, stupid!
144	The ox lows a loud "MOO" as you grab it by the horns and start
	dragging it.
145	The ogre leaps up to pound you with his club, but doesn't understand
	axes and you hack him to pieces.
146	The ogre grabs hold of the leg and starts gnawing at it ferociously.
147	The ogre glares at you and snarls. Ogres only eat dead flesh...
148	The ogre isn't in a mood to accept at present...
149	A brilliant flash of lightning erupts from the end of your wand and
	strikes the ogre in its chest. The smell of burned ogre fills the room.
150	"To be sure, I'm not hungry!" quips the leprechaun.
151	As you attack the leprechaun your blow goes straight through him
	without so much as harming his green tunic. "Bejabers, mortal weapons
	can't hurt the loikes of me!" he exclaims.
152	"I hope you'll be keeping your eyes off my gold, beghorra!" says
	the leprechaun, preventing your removal of his treasure.
153	Kicking and screaming wildly the leprechaun attempts vainly to
	escape from your grasp. "'Tis not fair!" he wails as you tuck him
	under your arm out of the way.
154	A dazzling red beam of light shoots from the end of your wand, and
	when you look again the leprechaun has disintigrated quite noticibly!
155	The windows are to provide light for you, not a vehicle for suicide
	attempts! The window is much too small in this room anyway...
156	You find your way blocked after a sudden fire and cave-in.
157	The way is blocked after a fire lead to a cave-in, twit...
159	You put your foot into the pool, but are suddenly stung with pain and
	withdraw quickly. The water seems very hot, although not boiling.
160	How can you swim pools frozen over solid? You have some STRANGE ideas...
161	The cupboard opens off its latch.
162	There isn't a latch this side of the cupboard, and you find you can't
	open it! Someone outside will have to do it.
163	The cupboard swings to, and latches itself shut.
164	To go up or down, say u or d. Do you think we put in commands like
	this for nothing?!
166	The cupboard is latched already, it won't latch any more!
165	The cupboard is open already if you hadn't noticed...
190	You need an axe (or wand) to fell a tree.
170	Try as you might, some strange magical force appears to prevent your
	removing either the bed or the bedclothes, although you could
	probably re-arrange the sheets if you wished.
173	The mattress of the bed is very hard and uncomfortable, so you get
	off it almost straight away.
174	Waving the brand causes it to go out.
175	Closer examination of an object does not reveal further information
	about it. You'll have to use your wits!
176	Oxen are beasts of burden. They leave giving rides to animals like
	horses and donkeys.
178	The icicle melts and soon evaporates.
179	The pool is too large to melt even partly.
180	The ox is very old, I'm afraid, and you soon realise that it would
	be as tough as old boots were you to attempt to eat it.
181	The tree has only recently been felled, so unfortunately you can't
	set it alight.
182	Living yew trees don't catch fire that easily above ground, I'm
	afraid!
191	When you put the head in place, a trapdoor opens in the floor!
192	The head is already on the wall, fool.
193	As you take the head, the trapdoor in the floor closes.
194	The head is fixed to the wall, but you could take it off if you
	said so...
195	The trapdoor leading up to the hut seems to be locked by some means.
196	The river flows from under the mountain here, so you can't follow it.
197	The eye appears to be fixed into its socket, and refuses to come
	loose.
198	The tunnel is too small to turn round in, so you can only move forwards.
199	You can't go in there taking along an ox!
200	You can't get the pillar through there! You'll have to take the ladder.
201	The pillar is too big to take with you through the crack.
202	With your combined strength, the portcullis raises!
203	It's already up, you imbecile!
204	It's too difficult for one person to lift. You'll have to get someone to
	help you, from the same side.
205	Silently, the portcullis glides shut.
206	It's already closed! Do you want to slam it through the floor or
	something?!
207	The equipment falls into the room below, and lands almost immediately.
208	If the tunnel has collapsed it means you can't enter. I'm saying this
	because it seems you haven't the mental capacity to understand the
	description given when you LOOK. Idiot.
209	What kind of an idiot ARE you? We don't have that sort of thing
	going on in THIS Land! Since wolfsbane isn't designed to be smoked
	you come out of it feeling pretty ill, too. Fortunately, this is a magic
	herb and regenerates itself. Now this time do something sensible with
	it, you dope...
210	You can't pick up a carpet like that! You'll have to roll it up first.
211	The carpet slowly rises into the air, and the colours of your
	surroundings blend together in a flood of bright ribbons and
	streaks. A second later, and you materialise once more.
212	You'll have to drop everything you're holding before you can
	get down that chute!
213	I do beg your pardon for not making the description clearer: THE
	CHUTE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCEND. Better?
214	The beach is cut off by the sea and cliff that way, forming a cove.
215	The sea is that way, and it's too far to the wreck to swim. Looks like
	you'll have to find a boat...
216	Your carpet rolls up easily.
217	It's already rolled up!
218	Your carpet unrolls. It doesn't look as valuable in this state.
219	Take another look, pal, it's already unrolled...
220	The door isn't open, you blithering idiot. SOME people...
221	It's a CRIMSON door, not an OPEN one.
222	You can't make something freeze something else. Try dropping the
	icicles into the pool instead...
224	You'll have to fix it onto the wall first.
225	For some strange reason you find yourself unable to get any treasure
	here. There may be some confusion in this room as to whether certain
	items are treasure or not (hint hint). Try getting stuff individually...
226	Some magical force drags the ring back to the floor irresistibly as
	you try to take it.
227	The ancient fossil slides into the brass ring, and disappears as you
	watch. The ring then transmutes to gold before your eyes, and becomes
	incredibly beautiful. The magic holding it to the floor goes too! Looks
	like you're in luck, chum!
228	The wand gives a perfunctory >PHUT< and disappears. To save you from
	wondering, it was the firestone it didn't like...
229	You need a magic wand with which to zap things, and you've not got
	one so nothing happens.
230	As you attempt to enter the passage, the wolf snarls, menacingly.
	Hastily you retreat, as the straggled, grey hair of the mangy beast
	rises up on its neck as a sign of anger.
231	The wolf shies away from you the instant you produce the herb. The
	next moment, it bays a terrible "AAAOOOOOOHHHH" and disappears!
232	The wolf devours your wand...
233	The wolf is a carnivore, which means it's more interested in eating
	YOU...
234	You don't honestly believe a beast as murderous as a wolf is going
	to go for walkies do you? Sigh...
235	The wand waves, but nothing magical happens! Perhaps you have something
	else magical which the wand dislikes? Or could it be somewhere nearby?
	(I'd better not say any more or I'll be telling you what it is...).
236	You wave furiously but no-one waves back...
237	The ox mechanistically explodes a loud "BOOM".
238	An intense white glow sprays from the end of your wand, and when
	it stops you discover that the portcullis has exceptionally vapourised.
	The air around you, however, seems to grow thin, and the scene fades
	away as some necromantic side-effect teleports you through space, and
	you re-materialise...somewhere...
239	The grate glows white as an infra-red ray generated by your wand
	causes it to heat immediately. A second later and it is gone - and
	so are you (to the fitted cupboard).
240	() GLOOP (). The fiery pit consumes anything which is dropped in it.
241	The pit may be fiery, but you can't ignite anything from it because
	the flames flash away too quickly.
243	You've got to be or have been an Enchanter to be able to use such
	a powerful magical feature of the wand. Since you're not that
	experienced yet, nothing happens.
244	You need a pen to be able to write.
246	Your message is written into the logbook, but the pen falls apart
	afterwards. You feel proud to have left your mark on The Land.
247	Very pretty, I am sure...
248	Fortunately, a sudden attack of common sense prevents your drowning
	yourself by getting rid of the boat whilst at sea...
250	How do you propose to blast something which hasn't got a fuse? Nothing
	happens...
251	>< KAPOW ><
	The door is no more! Neither is the powder for that matter...
252	The gunpowder gives a fizz but nothing else happens.
253	What?! Blasting things when there's gunpowder here with no fuse in it?
	You're taking a risk! Fortunately, the gods inform you of the
	suicidal outcome of your act and refrain you from doing it. Good of
	them, isn't it?
254	The fuse fixes itself in so hard that it is impossible to remove it. It
	seems to be stuck to some internal flint, so that you may be able to
	blast things with the powder...
255	You reach out, but suddenly the golden egg you are carrying starts to
	hum, and a powerful magical force interposes between your hands and
	what you wish to get. After a few seconds trying, you have to give up.
256	When you attempt to drop the egg it starts to hum, and a powerful
	magical force causes your fingers to grip it all the more tightly. You
	find it is impossible to drop it.
257	The egg hums, and falls into the pit with a happy () GLOOP ().
258	This is a golden egg, not a hard-boiled one. Nothing happens.
259	Nice try, but it doesn't work! If the egg is magical, it will probably
	need a much greater amount of heat before it'll allow you to drop it...
260	The egg starts to hum, but figures the fire isn't hot enough for its
	tastes and won't let you drop it. You'll need something a little
	hotter before it will let you get rid of it. Or, of course, you could
	give it to someone...
261	Someone who is no longer a novice, such as yourself, should find it
	beneath themself to play with TOYS...
262	As you attempt to let go of the object, you find to your horror that
	it adheres to your fingers! Try as you might, you find you cannot drop
	it or otherwise rid yourself of its presence. Maybe it's something else
	you're holding which is magical? You might have to give it away...
263	The ogre is already dead. Killing it again won't make the least bit of
	difference.
270	The way is blocked by the sliding panel.
271	Some strange, invisible, magical barrier blocks the way, and you can't
	get past it.
272	The river goes underneath the mountains (it flows east to west) and
	you cannot follow it.
273	The robust door in the way easily prevents your moving in that
	direction.
274	The powder has to have a fuse in it before it's any use fixing it
	to the cannon.
275	The cannon is now primed.
276	The cannon is now loaded and primed.
277	You need to put gunpowder into the cannon before you can shoot it.
278	Cannons require the insertion of some spherical projectile before
	they'll shoot.
279	Out from the end of the cannon flies the sphere, and it smashes into
	the robust door with an almighty >| CRASH |< . When the smoke clears,
	both door and sphere are gone...
280	Don't you know ANYTHING? You have to put gunpowder in these things
	first! Silly!
281	The balls starts to roll away, then the platinum scrapes off and it
	stops. The platinum disappears, with more than a hint at the involvement
	of some sort of magic...
282	the ball is magically prevented from rolling away.
283	The door remains locked shut.
284	A ray of intense yellow light streaks from the end of your wand. After
	it stops, however, the door remains intact. You notice this as you
	dematerialise...
285	The fountain changes colour to yellow, and you suddenly feel more
	relaxed, confident and sure of yourself than when you did before you
	entered...
286	You get wet.
287	You can't open the door from this side! Read the description!
288	There's no keyhole this side of the door...
289	You can't pick up goblins!
291	The goblins surround you so that you can't escape.
292	The goblins surround you, and poke their fingers into you so that you
	can't open anything because of the distractions.
293	There are so many goblins here that it looks impossible to destroy
	them. Your wand starts to throb, and to glow with a deep blue light
	which turns into a flashing violet. Suddenly, a scything red ray
	cuts from the end and slices through all the goblins as it bites through
	the air. They fall to the ground, clawing at whatever they have left for
	heads, and your wand glows black with their blood.
294	You can't get a proper grip on the panel to be able to move it.
295	The panel slides...
296	It's already been slid open, idiot!
297	I appreciate your closing doors behind you, but this one's shut already.
298	The panel slides open.
299	The panel slides shut.
300	\ KAZAM / - the panel disappears!
301	Drinking when there's a barrel of putrid water here is unwise, you
	might catch something!
302	OK!
303	Out from the end of the cannon flies the ball, but it misses the door
	and smashes into the wall. Unfortunately, the damage to the wall is
	minimal, and when the smoke clears the ball has disappeared... Next
	time you'll know to shoot the door with the cannon...
304	*The scroll reads as follows:
	"From beneath the crystal curtain,
	 Salt to west and hard to cross,
	 Go south to the death so certain,
	 Though follow me and have no loss...
	 South again, the danger stronger,
	 Once more, or you feel the spray,
	 Travel on that way no longer,
	 Southeast, else you slip away."
305	You can't read in the dark, berk.
306	The scroll ignites, and a few seconds later its ashes scatter to the
	winds.
309	The quill doesn't work for some reason.
310	It's a pretty robust icicle. You'll have to melt it with a torch or
	something.
311	The bunny happily disappears into the warren, and you get a warm
	feeling inside that you have done something really worthwhile.
312	The bunny kicks a little, but its resistance is futile as you
	bash its brains in.
313	The bunny sniffs the herb, then eats it all up.
314	Rabbits don't eat potatoes (well this one doesn't anyway!).
315	The dead rabbit falls into the hole, but not out of reach.
316	It's already been murdered!
317	You can't eat LIVE animals! Ugh!
318	It was a bit stringy, but not bad.
319	The beggar wants to be fed with food. If you've got some, try
	phrasing it differently.
320	The bunny isn't hungry.
321	The rabbit's fur catches fire with astonishing speed, and a second
	or two later, all that is left are charred remains which you throw
	away in disgust.
322	'Fraid it's too heavy, old bean. These mariner types don't mess
	around with itsy-bitsy sized notebooks, you know!
323	Out from the end of your wand flashes a blinding scarlet bolt of
	power, which atomises the fiend in no uncertain terms.
324	The undead interposes itself and prevents your action.
326	The bunny suddenly turns savage and you daren't.
327	Berk.
329	There's no place to hang it. Look for somewhere with other trophies
	on the wall instead.
330	You climb as far as you can, and come down again when you hit your
	head on the ceiling.
331	You suddenly feel all funny, there is a puff of smoke, and to your
	dismay you find that you have become female.
332	You begin to feel weird, there is a sudden flash of light, and to
	your surprise you find you have become male.
333	He doesn't want to be got.
334	It dives into the pond and hides under a rock when you try to get it
	and only comes back to the surface after you stop.
336	It tastes of warts.
337	All of a sudden there is a flash of deep blue light, and the frog
	transforms into a handsome prince!
338	He politely tells you to clear off before he bashes you in the face.
339	There is a sudden radiance about the man, and your heart cries out
	for him when suddenly he becomes hazy and disappears before you can
	suggest anything else. Sobbing because of your lost love, you
	nevertheless grit your teeth, forget it, and soon feel better!
340	He suddenly glows, then becomes hazy and disappears before you can
	clobber him one. Your swinging sword meets thin air (and doesn't kill
	that, either).
341	It's too shallow. Can't you read, you short-sighted loon?
342	The tunnel has collapsed and you can't move.
343	The creature of the night mindlessly accepts the leg, gnaws at it, then
	moans a long chilling scream and disappears in a puff of green fumes.
	You find the teethmarks have gone from the leg when you examine it
	afterwards...
345	rabbit dropped
346	The sleeping beauty remains asleep, her enchantment unaffected by a
	kiss from a female due to the witch who cast the spell noting that she
	had many sisters and no brothers...
347	The sleeping beauty's eyes start to open, she sits up, yawns, kisses
	you again, then there is a flash of purple light and she disappears. You
	are naturally upset by this, but the kiss was so good as for you to
	feel much better as a result of the experience!
348	Her eyes open, and she starts to fight back!
349	The door won't open.
350	It's too difficult for one person to lift, you'll have to get someone to
	help you.
351	With your combined strength, you slide the bookcase aside.
352	It's already been opened, why don't you LOOK?
353	With your combined strength, you slide the bookcase against the wall.
354	It's already against the wall, take a look stupid.
355	The bookcase slides aside easily revealing an opening.
356	The bookcase slides up against the wall.
357	The grate slides open.
358	The grate slides closed.
360	Tap...tap...tap...
361	All of a sudden there is a swirl of magical colours, and before you
	can think, a flood a bright reds and greens whirl around, then part.
	You find you have been teleported somehow...
366	You find that you cannot lift the vial more than a few inches. You could
	just about drink some of it though... Not that I'm trying to give
	you any hints.
367	You sniff the heavenly vapour, then everything swirls about you, the
	crystals disappear, and you black out. You'll be able to wake up in
	ten seconds time - meanwhile you have become female!
368	You take a whiff of the divine aroma, then the crystals vanish,
	everything goes black, and you pass out. You'll be able to wake yourself
	in about ten seconds, but in the meantime you have become male!
369	They tasted kinda salty.
371	They're COLOURED crystals, pill-head. We don't have that sort of
	substance around in THIS land!
372	The dirt comes off easily, and you find that the groats are really
	made of gold and are very valuable!
373	Rub...rub...rub... Nothing happens.
376	The pancake flies into the air, spins over, and lands perfectly in
	the pan, which then crumbles to dust. You get a lot of fun out of
	this obvious demonstration of mankind's superiority over pancakes.
374	You pick up the pan, but the further you move it, the harder it
	becomes, until you have to put it down again. You can't even
	get the pancake from the pan! There is something magical about
	this...
377	You try to pick up the pancake to take a bite, but it grows
	incredibly heavy and you have to drop it before being able to
	take a mouthfull (and probably contracting botulism).
378	You think that were you to leap then perhaps you'd splat in the sands
	below unless you had a parachute.
379	The horse decides not to bother flying, since when it flies it comes
	here anyway. You might try riding it instead.
380	The wand doesn't fit. Perhaps something a little smaller, like a stick?
383	You obviously haven't read the description...
384	A curious radiance surrounds the sundial, then suddenly an amazing beam
	of light scythes from it and hits you square in the chest. A feeling of
	power floods through your body, and when you look again, the stick in
	the dial has gone.
385	The skies are too overcast to enable the sundial to cast a strong
	enough shadow by which you could tell the time.
386	It's already got a brand in it, birdbrain.
387	You can't put a lit brand in there or you'll burn your hand!
388	The brand fixes solidly into the sundial, in fact so solidly that you
	won't be able to take it out. It looks like the sundial will work now.
389	You can't burn sundials, stupid; they're not made out of marshmallow
	you know...
390	The sundial's pointer burns away with incredible speed, until there
	is just the stone part of the object left.
392	As you try to crawl down, something inside the sett claws at your face
	and you are forced to retreat hastily back to the surface.
393	As you enter the glade, your axe suddenly becomes unbearably hot, and
	you stagger back out of the glade, where it magically cools within an
	instant.
394	The horse refuses to acquaint itself with anyone dragging along an ox.
395	The stallion flies out of reach until you stop trying to kill it.
396	The stallion grows hazy and transparent, then with a loud "NEIGH" flies
	off back whence it came.
397	The stallion neighs a loud "NEIGH" as you take it by the mane and start
	dragging it.
398	You get onto the back of the winged stallion, and it rears up on its
	hind legs, neighs a loud "NEIGH", and flies off, passing with ease
	through all interposing solid bodies. A few seconds later it lands, and
	you dismount...
399	You'll have to get the horse first.
400	The horse won't let you get on its back, probably because of something
	you're holding or which is nearby.
401	The winged stallion will not let you, and rears up on its hind legs
	dashing its hooves perilously close to your head until you stop.
402	This isn't the proper place to bath it.
403	The gull suddenly stops moving, becomes hard, and an instant later
	has changed colour too and become solid gold.
404	Nothing happens, since gold birds don't get too dirty.
405	The bird is not hungry. Few creatures in The Land are...
406	You can't feed golden birds!
407	You can't kill a solid gold bird, berk!
408	It wasn't much fun, really, it didn't put up much of a fight.
409	Fool, you'll break your teeth if you bite gold!
410	The feathers and beak weren't too tasty, but the rest was passable.
411	The bird flutters out of reach every time you try to remove a feather.
412	You can't pluck birds made of gold, imbecile!
413	The bird refuses to be dropped in the nest of an eagle. If the owner
	came back it would get ripped to bits!
414	The gull refuses to allow you to drop it in such a hot place. Do you
	think it's stupid or something?
415	The bird doesn't fancy diving below freshwater, but it wouldn't mind
	the sea if you REALLY want to get rid of it.
416	The lion lands on its side, and points nowhere.
417	The lion lands on its base and points southeast.
418	The lion lands on its base and points northwest.
419	The lion lands on its base and points south.
420	The lion lands on its base and points north.
421	The lion lands on its base and points northeast.
422	The lion lands on its base and points southwest.
423	The lion lands on its base and points west.
424	The lion lands on its base and points east.
425	The lion lands on its base and points north.
426	The lion lands on its base and points south.
427	Are you trying to kill the poor thing? It just needs bathing, not
	drowning...
428	The gull you are holding flaps its wings and creates such a fuss that
	you can't enter the hut. It doesn't like the stuffed animals in there.
429	The water isn't drinkable, loon.
430	You flap you arms a bit, but cannot fly. Most normal people wouldn't
	be surprised by this...
434	You reach for the cat, but the bird you are holding squawks loudly
	and flaps its wings about your head until you have to stop and leave
	the cat where it is.
435	The bird flies out of reach, and lands again when you give up. It
	doesn't like cats, dead or alive...
437	The ivy is stuck on tightly. You can't get it, burn it, or do anything
	else to it. To be honest, it's only there to make the description
	better. Concentrate on the sundial instead.
438	In goblin rooms, it's difficult to define things as treasure. Get
	the objects individually...
439	Out from the end of your wand springs a dazzling green ray, and out
	of the wall springs an equally dazzling red one. They meet in mid-air
	and obliterate one another. The wall looks to be enchanted...
440	It's no use fixing that there, try something more regular in shape
	and more like a pointer.
441	You can't go in there taking a horse with you!
442	The ornament smashes into tiny shards as it strikes the floor, and
	is lost forever. And don't try to pick up the shards as they're so
	small you can hardly see them...
445	You can't do that unless you have the magic mirror...
446	The mirror fogs over, then clears and you can see through it...
447	The mirror cracks, and the image fades. You look at the glass and it
	clouds over, turning to solid silver!
448	The mirror doesn't break. Ah well that's 7 years bad luck you won't get.
449	You can't drop the mirror while using it. Break it first.
450	You see your reflection...
451	>>>>>SPARE<<<<<
452	You aren't powerful enough yet. You must be at least a necromancer or
	necromancess.
453	The hound is incensed and attacks you!
454	Your spell didn't work; a magic amulet would have helped.
455	You need to be at least a sorcerer or sorceress to employ such a
	powerful artifact.
456	As you speak the final word, a demonic vibration resonates through the
	amulet, and it crumbles to dust.
457	Your spell didn't work; either try again, get more points, or use the
	oracle...
458	The oracle answers no more...
459	The oracle's magic is too strong for you: only enchanters,
	enchantresses and above can use the device.
460	The only mirror in The Land is a magic one, which you can't steal
	because of its enchantment...
461	Some unseen, diabolic force prevents your hand from being able to
	write. It seems to increase the nearer you are to the libram.
462	*The libram is old, musty, and has many pages missing, but you can
	make out some illuminated letters:
	"POTION: a draught mixed with medicine is something to be experienced.
	 CRYSTALS: take one sniff to be something you've always wanted.
	 RUNES:	read them to be in many places at once.
	 DIE:	the higher the roll, the more its value.
	 CAT:	do as your curiosity directs.
	 DOOR:	be polite when entering.
	Operating instructions:
	 ORACLE: 'where object' eg 'where crown'.
	 AMULET: 'force someone: do something' eg 'force Polly: south'.
	 MIRROR: 'watch someone', eg 'watch Richard'. To stop, break it.
	 HORN: 'summon someone', eg 'summon Brian', unless they've a firestone."
	Another page is about a magic wand, but it's unreadable.
463	Not surprisingly, you slip back. Don't you read descriptions or
	something?
464	You tug at the lever, then suddenly the floor beneath you opens up,
	and you fall down into a polished chute. The trap quickly resets, and
	you find yourself hurtling downwards at a furious pace!
465	It's immobile, but the floor below you seems hollow.
466	There is a hollow echo from the floor beneath the lever.
467	The horse refuses to set to sea.
468	You can't carry that barrel with you, the sea currents would smash it.
469	You can't take that great big marble pillar with you! You'd sink!
470	The rug is too cumbersome to take, rolled or unrolled.
471	The ox is too heavy to take along.
472	The horse is frightened of being pounded to death by the waterfall.
474	The ox is too weighty, and would crush you if you jumped with it.
475	I don't mean to be a prude, but you're the wrong sex.
476	Well you were SUPPOSED to kiss her, but I expect she doesn't mind... Her
	eyes open, she yawns, and before you can start the act there is a
	sudden flash of purple light and she disappears. This is a bit
	upsetting, but you still feel better on the whole for having known
	her, and soon get over it.
477	This is a rather young bunny and it doesn't know what to do yet.
478	You'd burst it...
479	Urgh! Necrophilia! Naturally the creature attacks you...
480	You can't do them all at once, and the rest attack.
481	He doesn't notice...
482	He may be grateful, but not THAT grateful!
483	He informs you in the nicest possible way that he's a prince, not a
	queen.
484	The chart tells of a legendary island, once inhabited by druids of
	an unspeakable evil, who worshipped demonic gods far fouler than the
	mere idols of the mainland. The ship was obviously sailing towards the
	island when a storm tossed it onto the rocks. Part of the chart is
	damaged, but to get from the rocks to the island you should sail
	southwest, northwest, then some unclear direction, then north, then
	north again. To get back to the mainland from the rocks, keep sailing
	east.
485	Ugh! Necrophilia! Urr...I feel sick...
487	Drop the treasure individually, feeblebrain, otherwise the pit
	will splash fire all over you when the stuff gloops into it.
489	It has been made of wood from an enchanted oak, and is
	indestructible. Go vent your anger on some trees instead.
490	You're already in the swamp, take a look you myopic dumbo.
491	The chart goes up in flames, and soon nothing remains
492	This is a magical tome, and it sends the flames back at the brand.
	You hurriedly drop the burning stick as it is engulfed in its own
	flames, and shortly there is nothing left of it.
493	The log of Captain Oliver burns to a useless cinder.
494	It's fireproof. Magic books don't burn just like that, you know!
495	You burn it to nothingness. Well wasn't that just SO much fun?
496	The bookcase is made of enchanted oak; enchanted oak is fireproof;
	ergo the bookcase is fireproof. Hmm, seems logical enough!
497	You rolled a 'six'.
498	You rolled a 'five'.
499	You rolled a 'four'.
500	You rolled a 'three'.
501	You rolled a 'two'.
502	The wand does nothing magical; it fears a great evil which it can
	sense nearby.
503	The sprig of mistletoe you are carrying pulls back magically as you
	try to leave, and with such power that it is plain you'll have to
	leave it behind if you want to go that way.
506	The trunk burns an extraordinarily raging flame, its contents, whatever
	they were, taking hold exceptionally quickly. Shortly afterwards, all
	that remains is a worthless pile of ash which you might as well ignore
	(I will!).
507	There could be something special about some treasure here you might not
	like. Get it individually and you'll see. This has been a public
	service announcement...
508	There's nothing here you could light anything from!
510	You haven't got a boat with you, and even if you had it would be
	smashed to bits by the dangerously rough seas - and you with it.
511	You need a boat, it's too far to swim.
512	That way is a rugged cliff, with a sheer drop onto rocks below! You'd
	kill yourself!
513	Use IN if you want to enter someplace, unless it is within the area
	you're in at the moment, such as a fountain or fairy ring would be...
	(me? hinting?)
514	There is a sudden SWOOSH of air, and you feel like your stomach has
	been pumped out. When you regain your senses, you find yourself back
	on the mainland...
515	You can't pick up a fairy ring!
516	It's not THAT sort of ring!
517	Nothing native to The Land eats poisonous toadstools, I'm afraid...
518	"To be sure, leprechauns don't eat fairy-ring toadstools", jests the
	leprechaun, merrily.
520	Toads don't eat toadstools, they sit on them. Toad-stool, it's really
	pretty easy to understand. This one doesn't want to sit on it, either.
	Perhaps it isn't REALLY a toad..?
521	No denizens of The Land eat mistletoe, with its being poisonous and all
	that...
522	The wolf snarls most ferociously and won't let you get anywhere near
	the herb to pick it up.
523	I see no sword!
524	The sword disappears.
525	The wolf snarls menacingly, and you can't pick up the herb with which
	to feed it!
526	The ogre leaps up to pound you with his club, but an omission in his
	education means he's never heard of swords and you hack him to bits.
527	You put it in your mouth, but it tastes so ghastly that you have to
	spit it out before you can swallow it. Maybe you should find some
	creature which eats ALL sorts of nuts normally?
528	Why would anything want to eat an enchanted acorn? It could change
	into an oak tree inside them or something!
529	The cup has some magical seal over the top which won't let any
	liquid pass through it. You can easily put your hand in, though,
	so it must just be the liquid it objects to...
530	The bird must be one of the few creatures in The Land which will both
	eat nuts and not care if they're enchanted. It devours the magic acorn
	and suffers no ill effects.
531	The squirrels have all scampered off, read the description. If you
	don't know what scampered means, look it up in any child's
	dictionary.
532	The squirrels won't let you pick up the nut to feed them with it,
	baring their incisors menacingly and snapping at your fingers when
	you try.
533	The squirrels become highly excited, and sit down pawing at the nut. They
	are very affectionate towards you, and you get a lovely warm feeling
	inside.
534	Squirrels eat nothing but nuts.
535	The squirrels won't let you touch their nut, and squeak loudly at you
	when you try to take it.
536	You grab hold of the nearest one, but just as you are about to
	take a mouthfull, the rest leap at you and bounce about all over you
	until you desist. They're more dangerous than they look!
537	You pick up one of the rodents, but the little sod bites your hand
	and you have to drop him. You realise it would be unwise to continue
	this approach.
538	It weighs a ton! You couldn't move it if you had thrice the elephants
	of Carthage to help you!
539	The bloodstained slab slides aside!
541	An inscription inside reads: "You have not the first of the four, the
	reaper of souls." The locket springs shut when you've read it.
542	An inscription inside reads: "You have not the second of the four, the
	crescent of the sun." The locket springs shut after you've read it.
543	An inscription inside reads: "You have not the third of the four, the
	empty grail." The locket springs shut after you read it.
544	An inscription inside reads: "You have not the last of the four, the
	holy plant of the sun." The locket springs itself shut when you've
	read it.
545	An inscription inside reads: "You have the four. The way to the
	treasure hall is safe." The locket springs shut again, as usual.
546	It's unclimbable, remember?
547	The object disappears!
549	To the northeast are steps up, downwards is a climb to a room below.
	Light comes from the surface via the opening in the roof of the room
	above. On the floor is mist, meaning you can't see any objects in the
	room (although there was sufficient draught when you entered to be
	able to glimpse them).
550	There's nothing here, really, just this niche. No ways out at all...
	The floor is covered in mist, so you can't see any objects dropped on
	it. Similarily, the inside of the niche is too obscured to see if
	anything has been put in it.
551	There is a sudden pang of pain which shoots up your arm from the
	chalice. It stops abruptly, and you see it was the effect of an
	ancient teleportation spell...
553	It's already opened, take a look.
554	It's closed already, look at it moron!
555	Put in objects individually, there may be particular treasures which
	have a startling effect if fixed there by themselves...
556	The squirrels eagerly take your nut and devour it amongst themselves.
	You get a lovely warm feeling inside with the happiness of a deed well
	done. (I don't know how I can write this stuff!).
557	If you want to feed the squirrels, say FEED SQUIRRELS WITH NUT, remember
	the little perishers eat the things... This has been a hint.
561	Nothing happens. Watch what you're doing when you wave things, you
	might wave the wand by accident...
562	Wave the wand? Pick it up, first, imbecile, do you expect me to do
	EVERYTHING for you?
563	immobile [imObIl] adj not moving; that cannot be moved; fixed.
	(Penguin English Dictionary, 3rd. edition).
564	Use an axe for chopping things, not a sword; swords are for KILLING
	with...
565	If you want to leave a place, say OUT; LEAVE is to leave parts of
	a room but not the rest, for example magic fountains... Enough
	repetitions of OUT will normally lead you to the place where you
	entered The Land.
567	The ogre swings his club and you dodge just in time to avoid his
	caving your skull in... Perhaps he ought to be killed, you think...
568	The rabbit kicks and thumps with its feet, wildly. Obviously it doesn't
	live here and dislikes the idea of being torn apart by something that
	does!
569	The fleece goes up in flames VERY quickly, doubtless due to the scented
	oils which had been soaked into it. Soon nothing remains but useless
	ash which crumbles away.
570	The skull isn't a trophy, child, it's just treasure.
571	The band is enchanted, and when you put it on a sudden weariness drains
	your senses, and a deep slumber befalls you. You remove the band, but
	all too late and the somnolence overwhelms you.
572	The potion burns to nothingness. Fun, eh?
576	It makes little difference. This medicine is so old it's just as nasty
	whether shaken or not.
579	The rat snarls, baring its yellowed teeth, and when you attempt to
	pick up the object it intervenes so that you can't. You'll have to
	wait until it leaves.
580	The rat objects to being picked up, and starts to fight!
581	Rats breed quicker than humans and are smaller too, so after a couple
	of seconds it's all over...
582	The cat lashes out and kills the unfortunate rat with one raking
	claw! It eats it, too, just to make sure.
583	The cat is dead, and doesn't seem to want to fight much...
584	The coal burns away to nothing. Well I hope you feel better after
	that.
585	You can't flee at sea. How can you drop everything and move if
	you're carrying a boat?!
586	The undead creature won't allow you to pick up anything while it's here!
587	You try to drop the egg to flee, but can't! You'll have to stay where
	you are.
589	You're taking a bit of a chance, aren't you?! Your brand lights,
	you impetuous fool...
591	The hole in the wall which leads out isn't large enough to let people
	through if they're holding anything. Drop your equipment if you want
	to go through.
592	HAWUMPH! The dragon incinerates you with its fiery breath.
593	Not a boat you don't, chummy: imagine the chaos if you do that sort 
	of thing at sea...
594	You can't get treasure in general here, because the pancake is treasure
	yet you can't pick it up for long. Get things individually.
595	I told you you couldn't enter it. I wasn't lying.
597	You make a hole large enough through which for people to pass.
598	With a ghostly creak, the tomb slides shut.
599	You can't dig for fear of bringing the tunnel down on you...
600	Use the axe, that's what it's for...
601	The fabric burns away until there's nothing left. Well that was a
	pretty stupid thing to do, now wasn't it?
602	The cliff is too steep and high to climb.
603	Did I understand you properly? You want to jump off without a
	parachute? Ha! Well consider yourself lucky I'm stopping you,
	otherwise it would have been "Splatsville".
604	You need a boat to sail to sea. EVERYONE knows that...
605	You have a good wallop with your bat, but conclude that it's best
	to use an axe, otherwise the years of rubbing linseed oil into the
	surface will have been in vain.
606	Have fun, hope you hit 'em for six.
607	The beggar stops. "Were I not deaf, I'm sure that would sound like the
	swish of a cri... no, it can't be", he thinks. Moments later his head
	isn't where he was expecting it to be...
608	Sorry old bean, some things just AREN'T cricket.
609	Well, that's what cricket bats are for, isn't it?
610	"Open not these tombs of yore,
	 They bear no common lock or door;
	 Upon each one is carved a guide
	 The wise may use to get inside
	 And reap the treasures that they hide."
611	The tombs won't budge. If you roped in half the armies in christendom
	they'd still remain closed. The magic sealing them is of a kind so
	timeless and powerful that no power on earth may break it, unless the
	riddles of the ancients are solved.
612	Nice attempt, but you didn't honestly think it would work, now did you?
613	The coffin creaks open, to reveal a body...
614	It's already open. Why don't you take a look, you'd save me a lot of
	work you know.
615	Slowly the sarcophagus creaks shut.
616	Yes, that's the idea, make sure it's well and truly stuck, even though
	it was already...
617	With an ear-shattering /C/R/E/A/K/ the entrance to the north tomb opens.
618	With an earth-trembling \G\R\O\A\N\ the entrance to the west tomb
	swings aside.
619	With a nerve-rending ^S^C^R^E^E^C^H^ the south tomb opens up.
620	With a mighty (B)(O)(O)(M) the east tomb's entrance rolls aside.
621	The horse doesn't like gallops when it can fly...
622	Why should the horse canter when it can fly?
623	You can't roll tombs, clod. My, but you're stupid.
624	There is a sudden awesome roll of thunder in your head, your wand
	splits into innumerable splinters, and you collapse to the floor in
	a dreamless slumber...
625	The north tomb is already open, nitwit.
626	The west tomb is already open, dummy.
627	The south tomb is already open, bumpkin.
628	The east tomb is already open, yokel.
629	The sarcophagus creaks open...
630	This sarcophagus is the resting place for the dead! It's not a box
	to store your treasures in, you unfeeling individual.
631	Rigormortis has set in and the body won't fit back.
632	Cannibal. Still, it was fair enough - although perhaps a little more
	seasoning would have made all the difference.
633	The creature from the grave mindlessly takes a bite from the body, then
	suddenly its face contorts in a horrible agony, the air rushes through
	its now voiceless throat as it tries to call in pain, and it
	disintegrates.
634	I see no body, but that doesn't mean there isn't one nearby...
635	The southeast tomb is already open, fool.
636	With a grinding S>C>R>E>E>E>E the southeast tomb slides open.
639	What, just cook it? How about cooking it on some fire..?
641	It's a male ox. Fair enough?
642	The sphere's a little heavy for cricket, I'm afraid. Why not hit
	people with the bat instead, that's what they're for...
643	You swing the sceptre, and an instant later the doorway is clear, the
	shattered protal splintered around you. Vandal.
644	Well you can bugger that for a lark...
645	It's dead. If you think you can kill something dead, you are quite
	welcome to try. I wouldn't waste your time trying here, though...
646	Disect away, you don't find a thing.
647	You're a necromancess, not a necrophiliac...
648	You're a necromancer, not a necrophiliac...
649	The dragon doesn't want the egg. It's not stupid, you know... Besides,
	the dragon's fire is magical, and doesn't melt eggs. You'll need some
	strong, non-magical heat source to get rid of it, I'm afraid!
651	Aha, I spotted that one! The niche won't fit inside itself, try
	something else, mug.
652	The southwest tomb is already open, clot.
653	With a vibrant G}R}A}U}N}C}H the southwest tomb opens.
655	The vase breaks into little tiny pieces. Well, it was only 4000 years
	old...
656	It's not a skeleton key...
657	It's tethered.
658	The goat doesn't want to be milked, and starts attacking you!
659	You can't take the goat with you in there!
660	The goat is too cumbersome to take along.
661	As you drop everything, the vase breaks!
662	As you drop everything, the ornament crashes to the ground, but
	miraculously it doesn't break!
663	It's an ordinary bed, nothing unusual under it like reds or anything.
664	The ox doesn't like goats and refuses to come along.
665	The goat is afraid of the ox, and won't be taken.
666	The horse doesn't care to be seen with anyone dragging a goat...
667	The nanny goat isn't too keen on the horse, and won't come along.
668	You can't ride goats!
669	You don't eat goats, twit. Whenever did you hear of anyone eating a
	goat? I don't know, some people are REALLY dumb...
670	The goat is outraged, and attacks you! Not that you can really blame
	it...
671	The goat enjoyed it, but nothing special happens. Do you like bearded
	females or something?
672	As you pick the remains of the now-fragmented goat from your tunic,
	you remember with fondness the way it boiled when your trusty wand 
	pointed in its direction...
673	It's already tethered, empty-head.
674	You'll have to catch it first.
675	You can't let go of the goat when you've got the egg.
676	Your way is blocked by the Undead.
677	The goat isn't daft, and refuses point blank to be tethered in the
	fiery pit!
678	The goat is tethered.
679	The goat is tethered, and sinks slowly into the swamp...
680	It weighs too much, which is just as well as it's a bit runny having
	been hacked up...
681	The goat is currently abstaining from magic pancakes...
682	The goat eats it.
683	The goat swallows the toadstool whole, and promptly keels over dead as
	a doornail. Ah well!
684	It's not a carnivore.
685	The goat devours the mistletoe, then seconds later falls quite dead. I
	wonder if the sprig was poisonous?
686	Nice try, but Chinese Boxing is no good against REAL dragons!
687	The goat won't eat.
688	It can't fly, you barnpot!
689	The goat is now untethered.
690	It already IS untethered. What do you want, some award for being
	excessively kind to animals?
691	Your spell doesn't work; either try again or use the hunting horn. Or
	get to be a wizard or witch, of course! In the meantime, however, the
	power of the magic has put you to sleep...
692	Only champions and above have the skill to summon with the horn.
693	A loud, clear note sounds from the horn...
694	Someone has been summoned by the horn already, and it only works the
	once.
695	A feeble squeek croaks from the horn. You're supposed to summon people
	with it, it's magic...
697	From somewhere in the distance comes a low reverberating sound.
698	The clear note of a horn sounds, somewhere in the distance.
699	You hear a loud "MOO" lowed somewhere.
700	You hear the >| CRASH |< of a cannon going off in the distance.
701	The loud >< KAPOW >< of a door being blown up assails your ears.
702	Your ears prick up at the sound of something being magically
	destroyed quite noisily in the distance.
703	A loud "AAAOOOOOOHHH" reaches your ears from afar.
704	You can't flee from such fiends, they get in your way. You'll have to
	wait until it goes, or kill it.
705	A distant neighing noise reaches your ears.
706	Using a lever, the bolt comes out easily.
707	The fork snaps in your hands and is destroyed.
708	The brand isn't strong enough.
709	The wand is too short to use as a lever.
710	The bolt is too deeply embedded to get it out, you'll need a strong
	lever.
711	The brand falls to bits. Ah well!
712	The wand is indestructible, so you can't sharpen it.
713	Sharpen it with something like a knife if you REALLY want to...
715	There is a sudden crack of thunder and the gate opens!
716	In the distance you hear a crack of thunder.
717	The ore comes out quite easily when you use the pickaxe.
718	After a struggle, the ore comes out.
719	It's embedded in the face, you'll have to use some strong sort of
	tool to get it out.
720	It's not stuck in anything!
721	The water flows smoothly through your body and fills you with a vibrant
	energy. A second or so later, however, you feel dizzy and find yourself
	collapsing into a deep sleep...
722	The dwarfs have treated their trees with a special hardener just to stop
	louts like you from chopping them down...
723	The emerald plummets downwards, and lands somewhere in the cavern below.
726	It falls down the duct and you hear noises which seem to indicate that
	the ventilator is perhaps some 40 feet down, vertically. Certainly
	enough to kill any human venturing there.
727	The bones fall to dust when you try to pick them up. If you're
	interested, most of them look like dwarf bones.
728	A bright flash sparks from the end of your wand, forcing you to drop it
	with the electric shock. In that brief instant, you see that you are in
	a section of main passage, which has been closed down because of the
	rockfalls. Then, everything goes black, and suddenly you re-materialise
	elsewhere...
729	There is a grinding sound, then you hear a deafening crash as of
	millions of gallons of water suddenly released from somewhere very
	close - about fifteen seconds away...
730	In the distance you hear a sudden rushing sound, as if a huge
	torrent of water has just started to flood somewhere.
731	There is a grinding noise, and then a barely audible flushing noise,
	as if a large body of water were seeping away.
732	There is nothing here, apart from a few bones.
733	The area is deep in flood water, you can't possibly hope to get past.
734	Pickaxes aren't any use at chopping down trees. Wouldn't it be really
	useful if someone invented a sort of axe with which you could chop trees
	down..?
735	You can't break down doors with pickaxes. Ordinary axes are OK, though.
736	The ogre doesn't understand pickaxes and you hack him to buggery.
737	You can't, its so deep you'd not be able to hold your breath for
	long enough.
738	Eh? There isn't any water here. You simple or something?
740	It's a safety lantern, and never gets hot enough to melt anything.
741	Your lantern is now lit.
742	The dragon's breath melts the lantern, catches alight the oil and blows
	you to pieces.
743	In the distance you hear someone being blown to pieces.
744	The lantern isn't lit!
745	This is a safety lantern, you can't use it to light anything.
746	Your lantern is now unlit.
747	He doesn't like eating golden potatoes, they have a nasty effect on
	his teeth.
750	You can't go that way carrying anything, the gap is too narrow.
751	The walls are too slippery, steep and tall to get up.
752	It's too far to climb up the cavern wall.
753	The citadel wall has been especially built to stop people climbing
	it from here...
754	The gate is closed and you cannot pass.
757	The trumpet emits a feeble squeak, which surprisingly rises sharply
	in loudness, and builds up to a crecendo. There is a sudden tremendous
	> CRACK < and the east side of the wall splits apart to reveal a dark,
	eerie room.
758	The trumpet emits a feeble squeak, which rises suddenly in loudness,
	but nothing else happens.
759	In the distance you hear a loud blow on a trumpet.
760	You can only cast sleep spells on people. If you want to go to sleep
	yourself deliberately, say sleep.
761	It's not that kind of pot, you degenerate.
763	The ox is as dead as a doornail. Showing it affection has not the least 
	bit of effect, apart from making you look a right idiot.
766	The sheepskin is too bulky to fit into any container.
767	You start to insert the mirror, but as you try to insert it, a
	magical force starts to push back. The harder you push, the more it
	resists. You realise it is a futile task, and give up. I wonder why
	that happened..?
768	The bird starts flapping about the instant it realises you're going
	to put it in the container. It causes such a kefuffle you can't get it
	in.
769	The leprechaun kicks wildly as you try to bung him in the container.
	"'Tis a bully you are!" he expounds, as he successfully avoids your
	suffocating him.
770	If you put that in the container it would break.
772	You can't put boats inside things! Imagine the problems if you
	try that sort of thing at sea!
773	You insert the nut, and an instant later it pops out again.
774	No matter how hard you try, the mistletoe will not go in the container.
775	The brand falls into the container, and promptly sets it alight. You
	realise what is happening and drop the container, and start stamping
	out the flames, but too late. The fire quickly consumes the container
	and everything inside it, so quickly that you get the impression it
	was magical. Presently, nothing remains.
776	How about "a pox on thee, foul villain", or "oh wretched crone, may
	thy visage be the abhoration of christendom", or "thou unspeakable
	manifestation of hellish damnation, may thee spend thy days
	languishing on the deepest plane of the Abyss", or "fuck off".
777	The cat swallows the bird whole, licks its lips, and gives a
	satisfied purr...
779	The cat lashes out and kills the bird dead as you are ever likely to
	find.
783	You take one almighty swing and the cupboard door flies off its
	hinges, destroyed. What did it ever do to you, murderer?
784	From the end of your wand sparks a violent beam of intense light,
	and an instant later the cupboard hasn't got a door any more...
785	You don't think they make portcullises so feeble as you'd be able
	to break them down, do you? What a twit...
786	An amber cone glows from the end of your wand, and the dwarf melts.
787	Out from the end of your wand flies a spectacular green ray, which
	scythes across the sky and slices into the dragon, to absolutely no
	effect whatsoever. Out from the end of the dragon's mouth flies a
	ball of fire...
788	Very festive...
789	You need to be carrying the boat to sail it.
790	If you want to sail the boat, just pick it up and move in the direction
	in which you want to go.
791	Some magical power in the rug prevents your taking it with you.
794	Nice try, its clever of you to think of doing that here but nothing
	special happens, I'm afraid. Well, not actually AFRAID afraid, well...
795	This is the only place you'll find a chop-downable tree. Why not chop it
	down with the axe? It won't fall on you.
796	Someone's already felled the tree here. No point in trying to fell any
	more if you want my opinion.
797	There's nothing fellable here! Try a forest.
798	Well pick it up then!
799	Suddenly you feel a stinging pain from your wand, and an electric
	charge runs through your body. You are forced to drop the magic to
	save your hand, then suddenly everything about you goes black, and
	an instant later you rematerialise...
800	It won't burn.
801	The priceless violin burns to nothing. Philistine.
802	The violin bow is now burnt away.
803	There's no electricity here.
804	Well, you have a good conduct and nothing happens. Count yourself
	fortunate I didn't hit you with a lightning bolt.
805	You feel a sudden, painful static electric shock from your bow,
	which makes you drop it in surprise. Moments later, everything goes
	black, and you feel like your stomach has just been sucked out. An
	instant afterwards, your surroundings swirl about you and you
	rematerialise...
806	It's not wide enough, try something thicker, such as a stick.
807	The lion lands with a splodge and sinks, pointing nowhere.
808	The pot is stuck closed, but you can put things in it through the
	gaps in the wickerwork so it doesn't really matter.
809	It doesn't make much difference with the sack, opened or closed.
	Nothing will fall out anyway, and it's airtight.
810	It's already open, why don't you read the description?
811	The bag creaks open slowly.
812	The bag is now closed.
813	It's already closed.
815	You'll have to furl it first.
817	After a modest explosion, the shark appears to have disappeared.
818	Well it tasted pretty bad, but you wolfed it down eventually.
819	Well pick it up then! There's a method to these things...
820	I don't suppose you'd care to use a bow, would you? Pizzicato ruins
	your fingernails.
821	Out from the violin come a few bars of Paganini's Caprice no. 21.
822	Don't mention it...
824	They made headstones much stronger in the old days, so the likes of
	you wouldn't go around vandalising cemetaries.
825	In the distance you hear the strains of a violin being played.
827	The toilet flushes automatically and when you look, it's empty!
832	When you try to manipulate the object, your egg starts to make a
	humming noise, and you find some strange, powerful magic force prevents
	your continuing...
835	It floats off down the river.
837	You feel a sudden sharp pain in your hand and drop what you were waving,
	but nothing else special happens...
838	You can't get a grip on the bookcase from this side good enough to
	enable you to slide it.
839	All of a sudden, to your shock and amazement, your violin cracks and
	splinters to nothingness!
847	It's a thick slab of rock, you couldn't break it if you dropped a
	rhinosceros on it from 2,000 feet. Isn't it obvious you're supposed to
	sacrifice something there?
848	Have you ever thought how much cannons weigh, chump?
850	The patterned curtain is now drawn open.
851	The patterned curtain is now drawn closed.
852	The curtain's already open! Take a look, pachyderm!
853	The curtain's already closed! Why not take a look, donkey?
854	The curtain won't hang properly here.
855	It's already hanging up!
856	The curtain is now hanging loosely by the opening to the north.
857	The richly-woven pattern reads:
	"When the eyes are red you may pass the ghouls,
	 But if treasure is wanted then emerald rules."
	There are also some numbers written: "50" in red, "100" in blue,
	"150" in green, "200" in yellow and "250" in emerald green.
858	You hear a voice, which seems to come from inside your head, calling
	you from afar...
859	It's already full of rum.
860	There's no fresh water here.
861	The bottle fills, and its contents magically become rum!
863	It's highly acidic, and you swallow a mouthfull of the burning liquid
	before spitting the rest out! I certainly wouldn't advise swimming in
	the stuff...
864	The bottle won't fill.
865	The bottle shatters to uselessness.
866	The bottle's empty! You'll have to fill it.
867	It's not raining!
868	Yo-ho-ho! That was powerful stuff! Hic!
869	If you want to consume something, go ahead and do so. I'm not having
	any of this wishy-washy tasting going on...
870	All of a sudden, you are feeling quite woozy, and fall asleep.
872	Very resourceful, but regretably the bottle doesn't fill.
875	How do you expect to do that? You haven't got a funnel, it'd go all
	over!
876	If you want to fill anything, the most appropriate thing I can suggest
	which you are liable to encounter is a bottle.
877	The room before you seems to swim around, and you stagger backwards...
878	You find a potty under the bed, containing some jet!
880	Over the cliff it goes!
881	In the distance you hear a loud PLONK.
883	HIC!
884	You've got the hiccoughs. HIC!
885	It won't eat it.
886	The hyacinth is a type of flower, not flour. Still, you managed to get
	it all down without too much coming back up.
887	Mmm! Smoked hyacinth, it tastes delicious!
890	Over you go! For some reason, you don't plummet like a stone...
891	You land safely!
892	You're already heading that way. The total time taken for the jump
	should be about 8 seconds, if you're worried about missing a 'bus or
	something...
893	If you're falling, anything you let go of would fall the same speed as
	you, wouldn't it? So you can't REALLY drop anything until you reach the
	bottom...
894	I can't let people go around furling as they fall, they'd plummet
	downwards and splash on the rocks. Keep your country tidy!
895	The dragon eats the coal. Seemed to enjoy it!
896	In the distance you hear the terrible RHOAAAUUUAURRRRGGGGGGHGHHHGHHHH of
	a dragon dying...
897	It has no roots, so I'm afraid you can't plant it.
898	The flower falls to bits. Ah well!
899	It smells of hyacinth.
900	He's allergic to flowers, but thanks you all the same.
901	She's not in a position to accept at the moment...
902	I'm sure that whoever's buried there will be very grateful.
903	The flower doesn't perk up much, but then it didn't look like it was
	going to die anyway.
904	The flower withers and dies.
905	The vase is so delicate that the weight of the flower breaks it!
906	No, that's not it. Resourceful of you though!
908	You find that the lantern won't light, the reason being that it's got no
	wick.
909	Your lantern's wick has just burned out.
910	The lantern's lit, you'd burn your fingers.
911	You fix the new wick into the lantern.
912	It won't come out.
913	There isn't one in there.
915	You come out of the end of the chute and land with a thump on the floor.
916	All of a sudden you go over a bump in the slippery tunnel, and start to
	decelerate.
917	Your're already going downwards, and since you have little say in the
	matter I suggest you sit back and enjoy the ride...
918	It's fireproof, ask the dragon.
919	A single swing with the mighty axe fells the signpost.
920	The chop has no effect.
921	It resists your vandalism with commendable disdain.
922	From the end of your wand shoots a pencil-thin ray, which explodes the
	signpost almost instantly. Ooh!
923	The signpost is a bit weatherbeaten, but you can make out:
	"B WA E dr gon at  a ge, e tr me y dan ero s, bu  sh uld di  if fe 
	 c   ."
	Appended to the bottom, and more readable, is
	"Drop boats here until you leave for the mainland - dangerous currents
	 will sink you if you move off the island from anywhere else".
924	It's fixed into the ground, you can't move it. Might be able to chop
	it down if you tried, though.
925	The stem isn't long enough to fix it anywhere, I'm afraid.
926	~D~O~N~G~
927	Ringing through the air you hear a loud ~D~O~N~G~.
928	You hit the bell, and it rings a loud ~D~O~N~G~.
929	Now you've dropped a clanger!
930	It won't touch the demon drink...
931	The bottle's empty, a fat lot of use it is feeding something with it.
932	The creature of Satan swallows some of the rum, but is mindless anyway
	so it has no effect.
933	The dragon's fiery breath ignites the bottle in your hands, and you
	only just escape injury from the flying shards of glass! Talk about
	fire water...
934	The beggar takes a gulp, passes back the bottle, then starts to sway
	a bit. Unused to strong alcahol, in a sudden stupor he attacks you!
935	You take hold of the cord and find, to your horror that you stick to
	it! Try as you might, it won't come off, and you find to your horror
	that it is part of the immense web of some huge spider! Taking hold of
	the cord is bound to have informed the creature of your presence, too!
936	You're stuck in the web, how could you pick it up?
937	The spider suddenly springs at you!
938	Well fair enough, worth a try I suppose. There's no special effects
	as a result, though.
939	The web catches fire, and an instant later you are free!
940	You can't move that way, you're stuck in an enormous web!
941	You're stuck in the web and can't move enough to do that.
942	You haven't enough freedom of movement to wave anything.
943	You can't it sticks to the web.
944	It's far too sticky for that! What do you think it's made of,
	marshmallow?
945	You sink your teeth into the cord, only to find that you stick! The
	cord is part of an immense web, which you see as you attempt to
	struggle free. I wonder whether the spider will be attracted?
946	From the end of your wand flies a blue bolt of highly-charged
	electricity. PZINGGG no more spider...
947	The wand erupts forth a cone of fire which destroys the web no end.
948	Under the bed is not the sort of place to keep that sort of thing. Now
	if you'd tried a potty on the other hand...
949	The flood water is too deep there, the only dry place around is the
	top of the citadel.
950	The potty slides out of sight under the bed.
951	It's already open, if you want to toggle open/close just TURN VALVE.
952	It's already closed, if you want to toggle open/close just TURN VALVE.
953	The horse was expecting to land on solid ground, so when its feet are
	sucked under it is surprised, and unable to take off. Happily, you
	watch it sink to oblivion. Brutal so-and-so.
954	The stallion snorts forth ferocious billows of steam - it obviously
	objects to what you're trying to do. Drop things some other way, it
	MIGHT let you...
961	You can't summon people when you're falling!
962	OK, so you burn the cord. Wasn't that a whole heap of fun?
963	The sword isn't flaming, it just glows in the dark (and in the light,
	too, come to that!).
964	The runes read, "If you were less experienced than enchanter, you'd be
	blown up now!".
965	You haven't a watch.
966	Rarely have you witnessed a cat explode with such force.
967	The wand unleashes a screaming bolt of power, but the door withstands
	it. It must be magical...
972	Your wand leaps from your hand, and beats the snake to death! It
	then wipes itself on the ground and returns to your grasp.
977	The cat has eaten the rat!
978	The blade of the sword is so sharp as to be able to slice even through
	the sticky, gooey web! An instant later, and you're free!
983	You try to move that direction, but your feet seem rooted to the spot.
	A suitably mysterious, eerie sound whirls about you, warning that the
	magic of the ancients objects to your taking something you're carrying
	along with you...
984	Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!
985	What, and break your teeth on them? They're golden!
986	~D~I~N~G~
987	Ringing through the air you hear a loud ~D~I~N~G~.
988	You hit the bell, and it rings a loud ~D~I~N~G~.
989	The golem interposes its iron frame, and blocks your way through the
	opening.
990	The sword barely chips at the golem, but it's better than nothing.
991	It breaks on the golem's mighty iron torso! The guardian turns to you,
	silently...
992	There is a flash of violet light from your wand, and you feel like you
	are being pulled apart. Momentarily, everything goes black...
993	You fall asleep, deep in meditation.
994	This is no place to meditate, try a shrine or chamber of some kind.
995	There isn't sufficient meditation going on elsewhere to provide the
	psychic energy to meditate in such a small shrine as this.
996	You feal a great tranquility filling your being, and when you cease
	your meditation, you are in a strange place...
997	You start to meditate in this holy place, and the darkness around
	you seems to close in. All of a sudden, it clears...
998	The gate closes.
999	It's already closed! I bet you're the sort of person who turns back to
	their house after walking 20 yards "in case" they forgot to switch the
	gas off...
1000	You make a good job of it, and feel quite proud of yourself.
1001	The throne is too small to sit in, but it looks to be worth a bob or
	two.
1002	Not THAT sort of prize, idiot!
1003	It's not really supposed to go on a wall. Why not just drop it in the
	swamp and forget about it, eh?
1004	The oven door isn't open.
1005	OK, but the oven isn't hot enough to do much damage.
1006	The oven is now open.
1007	The oven is already open, are you trying to get in or something? Perhaps
	it would be best for all of us if I let you...
1008	The oven is now closed.
1009	It's already closed, twit.
1010	The oven's coals are out of reach, so you can't light anything from them
	I'm afraid.
1011	The rabbit leaps suicidally into the recess where the hot coals are, and
	that's the last you see of it!
1012	OK, but the oven's probably hot enough to ignite the gunpowder after a
	while...
1013	You hear a loud explosion.
1014	The guard blocks your way.
1015	Your wand lets forth an amber cone of light, but it merely bounces off
	the dwarf!
1016	The gateway needs a key to open it. Say "open gate with <key>", where
	<key> is what you think the necessary key is...
1017	The gateway swings silently open...
1018	It's already open. Making sure, were you?
1019	It's not THAT kind of chip!
1020	>>>>>SPARE<<<<<
1021	With a mighty heave, you withdraw the longsword from the rock!
1022	The dwarf is already awake, dope.
1023	The dwarf wakes up!
1024	The gateway won't open.
1025	You kill the sleeping dwarf with a single blow, but it wasn't much
	fun.
1026	It continues to sleep.
1027	The dwarf is very surprised!
1029	It's already thrust into the rock, and won't go any further.
1030	The longsword slides into the rock, smoothly and silently.
1031	Not while you're falling!
1032	You can't use the wand if you have the longsword, and, unluckily for
	you, you have both!
1033	The trapdoor won't budge.
1034	The bed is already unmade!
1035	It's tidy enough anyway, you're not one of those fastidious types
	who dusts rooms 3 times "just to make sure", I hope...
1036	The bed has been unmade with such enthusiasm that you soon realise
	you'll never be able to make it again (the bed I mean).
1037	Not THAT sort of Guardian!
1038	If you want your leg pulled, try playing under the name "Gail"...
1039	This part of the swamp is very treacherous, and as you move to get
	the object, the shift in your centre of gravity is too much. A trice
	later, and you're swallowed up into the mire...
1040	The bunny gives you a nasty nip with its sharp incisors.
1041	The bunny nuzzles up to you, oozing cuteness.
1042	That's a bit of a daft thing to do - if it was climbable it wouldn't
	have been much use building it. You start clambering up with enthusiasm,
	but all of a sudden slip on a loose stone and break your neck. Sigh!
1043	There is a sudden explosion, and you are blown to bits. A booby-trap,
	in case you haven't guessed...
1044	When you start to wave, the pillar magically rises into the air, then
	before you can do anything comes crashing down on you, pulping you
	and grinding you into the floor. Since humans do not function too
	well in this condition, you die. The pillar smiles to itself in
	satisfaction...
1045	As you reach for the skull, a terrible transformation begins to take
	place: skin starts to form on the ancient bones, and eyes well up in the
	sockets. The leering grin of the ram becomes apparent, and it starts to
	rise slowly into the air. Suddenly, it strikes! Its horns gouge deep
	into your eyes. You fall back in agony as the manifestation of evil
	gores you to death. Maybe that fleece nearby belonged to it once?
1046	A spectacular flash of glorious firework colour erupts from your
	wand, accompanied by a tremendous clap of thunder, and a bit of a
	scream as you find that the marble pillar is so strong that it
	reflects the spell back at you and you go up in smoke! Trouble-
	maker!
1047	When you open the chest, you discover that it contains clothing.
	Unfortunately, said clothing came from a village whose entire
	population was wiped out shortly afterwards by a particularly
	virulent plague which kills instantly, as you suddenly discover
	when you come out in rose-shaped blotches and drop dead. The lid
	of the trunk conveniently slams shut afterwards, awaiting another
	victim... Sorry about that!
1048	The spider scuttles over to where you lie helplessly trapped in her
	web, and she sinks her fangs into your torso. You black out, and...
1049	You manage to budge the sword a little way, but you're not experienced
	enough to dislodge it yet. Maybe if you made it to superhero or
	superheroine you'd be able to?
1050	As you move, the swamp enfolds about your body. Kicking and screaming
	as best you can, you can make but futile headway before the clammy
	marsh becomes too heavy and you are sucked to a terrible death by
	asphyxiation.
1051	I'm not telling you, so there!
1052	The thundering waterfall smashes you to pulp with its power.
1053	The sea suddenly becomes rough as a storm brews, and your little
	boat is overturned. Needless to say, you drown...
1054	You slide down the chute, an air of excited expectancy about you.
	This ends abruptly when you pile into an incinerator, which although
	no longer alight is nevertheless 40 feet below where you come out.
	You die, of a broken everything.
1055	You experience a relaxing, soothing sensation as you haplessly leap
	to your doom, which only goes away when you break to pieces on the
	rocks below. Do you think you're a lemming or something?
1056	You descend, when suddenly out from above swings a huge axe. You see
	it coming and try to swipe it aside, but it is too strong and you are
	cleft in two.
1057	You start your climb, and the rocky walls change to earth after a while.
	All of a sudden, your foothold gives and you tumble back, the hunks of
	earth you grab hold of coming away in your hands. You are knocked
	unconcious on the wall behind you, and bounce off all the way down. You
	are dead before you hit the bottom.
1058	You suddenly slip on a piece of wet seaweed and fall into the water.
	Desperately you cling on, but the waves drag you under and you
	finally drown. That's one way not to try again!
1059	You jump down, land on the rocks and are smashed to bits. Twit!
1060	() GLOOP (). What made you do that?!
1061	As you start crossing the pool, the waters enfold about you. You
	realise that they are magical, and they seem very hot as you
	splash about wildly, in a useless attempt to stop their dragging
	you under. After you have drowned, the waters wash up your
	possessions on the shore.
1062	As you start to enter the room, a horde of ghouls spring as if
	from nowhere and tear you limb from limb. There are so many that
	you are soon overpowered and consumed. The ghouls push your
	belongings back into the room whence you came, lest they alert
	future pickings...
1063	That's not enough, he wants something more substantial.
1064	The rabbit eats the wafer, and seemed to enjoy it.
1065	MMMmmm! Delicious! You feel better already!
1066	You feel rather tired.
1067	You pucker your lips to kiss the beggar, but as you close in on his
	mouth he tries to bite off your nose, his sadly dim mind thinking
	your head is food. Hastily you withdraw, since the beggar's teeth
	are nothing to be sniffed at.
1068	You hear everything you could before, only louder. Why not try
	diagnosing people with it?
1069	You can't read anything, you're blind!
1070	The flute doesn't seem to want to play. And after it was brought all
	the way here, too!
1071	The clear notes of a tuneful melody ring through the air.
1072	The clear notes of a tuneless melody ring through the air.
1073	You hear the clear notes of a flute ringing through the air.
1074	It doesn't play a note.
1075	It's chained up, you can't get it. You aren't EVER going to be able to
	get it, so don't bother trying!
1076	The words, "Aw, shucks, you shouldn't have..." flash across the
	headstone, then are gone.
1077	You see large, pink and blue spots floating in front of you.
1078	Inventive, but the icicles just float.
1079	The stallion scoops you up onto its back and flies off before you can
	stop it, passing through solid objects without let or hinder. Soon, it
	circles, lands, and dumps you off...
1080	Cremation, eh? Well it burns away quite quickly. Ashes to ashes...
1081	It smells just like the sort of thing that if you were a wolf you
	wouldn't like to be fed with it.
1082	Nothing happens. Well, the tree IS already felled!
1083	The incense quickly burns away, it exceeded its "best before" date
	several centuries ago...
1084	You start to climb it, but soon realise that it's too windy out
	here and were you proceed you'd be blown off. Reluctantly, you
	scramble down to earth again. 
1085	You don't see your reflection...
1086	What are you trying to do? Develop a hacking cough..?
1087	You can't steal the longsword, people guard it with too much
	ferocity for the likes of you to take it!
1088	It doesn't seem to want to go in the container.
1089	Very generous of you, but the longsword has a mind of its own and
	decides that you are quite good enough to wield it.
1090	The chain makes a large dent in the side of the golem!
1091	The king dwarf grabs hold of your leg and hangs on, preventing your
	leaving.
1092	The words are too faded to read, but you can tell that, in its day,
	it was rather good.
1093	At precisely 451 degrees farenheit, the magazine ignites and burns
	away.
1094	The goat has too much respect for such an august publication to eat
	it.
1095	As you fold the magazine, a fond reminiscence stirs you, of what once
	was...
1096	At the speed you're going?!
1097	Ah, good idea, but nothing special happens. Only by entering the
	fountain yourself may you gain any beneficial effects, and then only
	if it glows blue.
1098	OK, so it gets a bit wet. What did you expect would happen?
1099	It looks perfectly OK to me.
1100	The cat seems reasonably dead.
1101	The cat isn't feeling very well.
1102	It's not going to get up and hop away anywhere, I'm afraid...
1103	The bunny is as fit as a fiddle.
1104	The eagle rips the rat apart with its talons!
1105	The eagle tears apart the gull with its talons!
1106	The eagle wrenches itself from your grasp!
1107	The eagle relaxes in its nest, and its wounds heal.
1108	The eagle kills the rabbit with a single blow of its mighty talons.
1109	The eagle bursts into flames as a cord of red fire rorars from the
	end of your wand and engulfs it. An instant later, and the bird of
	prey is no more.
1110	It fits like a glove.
1111	Well OK, but nothing special seems to happen.
1112	Mmm, scumptious!
1113	No, no, not THAT kind of a kipper!
1114	Your heightened senses react badly to the enchanted waters, and you
	faint in a heap.
