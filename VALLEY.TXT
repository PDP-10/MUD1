bank1	light
	Bank of river.
	You are stood on the grassy, west bank of a fast-flowing river. The
	river flows from the north to the south, where can be seen a ford
	across it. To the west you can see a tumble-down stable, and in the
	distance north of that, mountains. On the opposite bank of the river
	is dense forest.
bank2	light
	%bank1
	This is the west bank of a river, which flows north to south very
	quickly. The opposite bank is forested, but here the ground is clear.
	To the northwest rise the steep slopes of a tall mountain, its peak
	towering high above the clouds.
bank3	light
	%bank1
	This is a narrow strip of land wedged between a fast-flowing river to
	the east, and a (climbable) mountain to the west. The river cuts its
	way north-south, and makes quite some noise. You can't see much of what
	the landscape on the opposite bank is like for the trees there.
bank4	light
	%bank1
	You find yourself on the bank of a fast-flowing river, where the
	heath to the west is parted from the forest on the opposite bank. The
	river flows from the north, and continues to the south, cutting off a
	narrow strip of land trapped between it and the steep mountain you spy
	to the southwest.
bank5	light
	%bank1
	Flowing from the northeast and curving viciously to the south is a
	fast-flowing river, upon the banks of which you now find yourself
	situated. On the opposite bank are trees, although the river is too
	quick to enable your swimming across. To the north is a curious, ornate
	wall, decorated in exotic, colourful designs of seemingly eastern
	origin. The wall is too tall to climb, as is the enormous hedge you find
	to the west, over the top of which you can just see what looks to be a
	belfry. The hedge stops on the edge of some trees, which are clumped
	together to the southwest.
belfry	small
	Inside belfry.
	You find yourself at the bottom of a belfry stood in a forest clearing.
	Outside, to the east the way is blocked by a huge hedge, and to the
	north is an ornate wall, decorated in colourful, oriental friezes.
	Elsewhere is more forest. The tower of the belfry rises high above
	you, but you can't climb the walls.
briar	light
	Briar patch.
	You are gingerly pushing your way through a prickly briar patch,
	skillfully avoiding being scratched from the many thorns about. To
	the north runs an east-west road, and to the east is a yard outside
	an old inn. South lies pasture, beyond which is a river, and west are
	the foothills of a majestic mountain, spearing its way through the
	fluffy clouds.
bridge	light
	Bridge over river.
	You are crossing a narrow, wooden bridge over a fast-flowing river.
	To the west lie the dark oaks of an evil wood, with the noise made by
	the river only adding to the eerie effect of their hideous shadows. At
	the eastern end of the bridge is a small island, bereft of trees, yet
	looking quite lush compared to the fearsome dark of the forest.
dead1	light	death
	Did you think you could fly? Sorry if I gave that impression...
dead2	light	death
	You jump up and down, but the extra force is too much for the part
	of the swamp where you stand, and to your horror you find yourself
	being sucked under! Well that's something not to try again, eh?
dead3	light	death
	The volatile marsh gases catch light from your naked flame, and before
	you know it, #WHOOMSH#...
efrst1	light
	Dense forest.
	You are wandering around in some dense forest on the west bank of a
	fast-flowing river. To the north, the river is crossed by a ford, and
	to the south it runs beside a meadow, beyond which you can see what
	looks like a belvedere of some kind. At that point the river splits,
	and curves round to the southwest of where you stand. West, the forest
	seems to be primarily of fruit trees, and northwest through the greenery
	you can see what looks like a well.
epstre	light
	East pasture.
	You are standing in lush pasture, irrigated by a river which curves from
	being to the east round to the north and continuing west of there to the
	northwest of where you stand. The pasture carries on to the west and
	southwest, but south is some rougher pasture which isn't so good.
ewd1	light
	Evil wood.
	You are wandering around in among the hideously deformed oaks of an evil
	wood. To the north and east runs a river, and west is a rough pasture.
	The wood gets thicker to the south, where it continues in an almost
	impenetrable darkness...
ewd2	light
	%ewd1
	You are forcing your way through the ancient, misshapen oaks which make
	up an evil wood. The only ways out which do not involve continuing
	into the denseness of the trees are to the north and west. Otherwise,
	the darkness envelops...
ewd3	light
	%ewd1
	You are thrusting your way through a mangled assortment of aged oak
	trees which are part of an evil wood. Northwards, the trees give way to
	a rough pasture, and to the easterly directions they continue in the
	same density as here. Other directions, however, the forest becomes too
	thick for you to force your way through...
ewd4	light
	%ewd1
	You are in the midst of an evil wood, surrounded by gnarled oaks of
	ancient origin. The forest continues all around you, in a darkness
	which seems unnatural, although to the south and southwest it appears
	too thick to move through...
ewd5	light
	%ewd1
	You are in the depths of a murky, evil wood, its gloomy oaks seeming to
	stare down at you as though watching your every movement. All around,
	the forest continues, although in the southerly directions it appears
	too thick to enable passage...
ewd6	light
	%ewd1
	You are in an evil wood, on the west bank of a fast-flowing river. The
	malformed oaks which enclose the area loom over you, throwing the whole
	place into deep shadow. The wood continues in all directions except the
	east, where the river runs, although to the south it is too dense for
	you to venture that way...
ewd7	light
	%ewd1
	You are in the middle of an evil wood, built up over many centuries from
	a ghastly assortment of wizened oaks, twisted into a tangled
	conglomeration. The forest continues in all directions...
ewd8	light
	%ewd1
	This is part of an evil wood, on the west bank of a fast-flowing river.
	The knotted, wicked-looking oaks continue in the south and westerly
	directions, but other ways is the river. Through the trees, to the east,
	can be seen a small bridge which spans the river to an island in mid-
	stream...
ewd9	light
	%ewd1
	You are pushing your way through the forlorn branches of some ancient
	oaks in the middle of an evil wood. All around, the wood continues, its
	oppressive gloom enveloping the entire scene...
ewd10	light
	%ewd1
	You are stood in the very heart of an evil wood, its intense blackness
	and eerie silence casting fear into your soul. The dense, warped oaks
	carry on in all directions, and their thick branches obscure the sky
	from view...
gazebo	light	small	silent
	Inside gazebo.
	This is an ornate and elegant gazebo, built on a small eminence to
	afford a better prospect of the surrounding countryside. North can
	be seen a lush meadow, beyond which is a forest, and further still
	a mountain. East is a fast-flowing river, which splits in two and
	curves from the north round to the west, as well as continuing to the
	south. Over the river can be seen forest, although south the trees are
	of a hideous, misshapen form.
heath1	light
	Rough heath.
	You are striding across a rough heath, between a forest in the north
	and a mountain to the south. East is the bank of a river, and west the
	heath continues. Through the trees to the north can be glimpsed a
	small tower of some kind.
heath2	light
	%heath1
	You are walking across a rough heath, which continues to the east, west
	and southwest. South is the base of a large mountain, the peak of which
	is partly obscured by the clouds which flank it some way up. North from
	here is mainly forest, although in the distance to the northwest is an
	enormous mountain, more majestic than the other.
heath3	light
	%heath1
	This is a band of rough heathland, which curves from the south to
	continue to the east. Southeast lies the base of a large mountain, but
	northwest are the foothills of one even larger, and far more majestic.
	North is forest, through which can be espied an ornate wall.
heath4	light
	%heath1
	You are scrambling over a rough heath, which rises out of a deep valley
	to the south and carries on to the north and northeast. East is the
	bottom of a large mountain, and west lie the foothills of an even
	greater peak. The ground here is very awkward to walk on, but you can
	keep your footing without too much trouble.
inn	light
	Inside the "Admiral Bombow" inn.
	You stand inside what used to be a cheery, hospitable tavern, which has
	now unfortunately fallen into a state of gross disrepair. All the
	windows have long since been smashed, and now only a howling wind
	whistles through where once there was warmth and light.
island	light
	Small island.
	You are stood on a small island in the middle of a fast-flowing river.
	The only exit is via a bridge to the west, which crosses the river into
	a dark, evil wood. The island itself, mysteriously enough, has no trees,
	but apart from that there is plenty of vegetation.
meadow	light
	Riverside meadow.
	You are strolling through a pleasant meadow on the west bank of a fast-
	flowing river. The river splits further to the south, and one branch
	meanders northwards to end up to the west of where you stand. North
	is a forest, and northwest a more cultivated section which seems to be
	an orchard. South, by the fork in the river, stands a gazebo.
mmtn1	light
	Middle mountain.
	You are on the north face of a steep, yet climbable, mountain. Above
	you to the south the slopes rise into the clouds, and poking out
	through the top you espy the peak. The mountain continues at this level
	to the southeast and southwest, whereas northwards is heathland.
mmtn2	light
	%mmtn1
	This is the west face of a steep mountain. The summit lies beyond a
	mantle of cloud which encircles the mountain just above you. Southwards
	and to the northeast the mountain continues at this level, but to the
	southwest it descends into a deep valley. North and west lie heaths,
	and beyond them the mighty slopes of another mountain.
mmtn3	light
	%mmtn1
	You are clambering about the southwest face of the Middle mountain.
	Just above you, to the northeast, lie clouds hugging the slopes and
	obscuring the summit. The mountain continues at roughly your present
	altitude to the north and east, but to the west the gradient increases
	dramatically and plunges into a deep valley. Southwards is a badly-paved
	road running east to west, and beyond that to the southeast is another
	mountain thrusting above the clouds.
mmtn4	light
	%mmtn1
	This is a steep, yet thankfully climbable, mountain. The present height
	above sea level is maintained to the west and northeast, but to the
	north the mountain rises into the clouds and beyond. To the east you can
	see a stable, and further still, a deep river. To the south is a badly-
	paved road running east-west, on the opposite side of which there is an
	inn.
mmtn5	light
	%mmtn1
	You are now scaling the rugged east face of the middle mountain.
	Although steep, it is still possible to ascend (into the mists which
	drape the mountain beneath the peak) and descend (onto the banks of a
	river to the east). At the same altitude, the mountain continues to the
	northwest and southwest, and ceases to the south where is nestled a
	ramshackle old stable.
mmtn6	light
	Misty part of middle mountain.

mmtn10	light
	Top of middle mountain.
	The marvellous panoramic view this spot affords is breath-taking in its
	splendour. Lower down the mountain, beyond the wreaths of cloud which
	circle this peak, are heaths to the north, beyond which is forest. To
	the east at the bottom can be seen a fast-flowing river, running from
	the north to diverge some way south, by a meadow. South, there is an
	old inn close by an east-west road, and southwest is another mountain.
	The scene is dominated, however, by a third mountain to the northwest,
	so immense that it dwarfs either of the other two. Its ancient slopes
	are shrouded in mist, with rugged cliffs running for hundreds of feet
	just below.
nfrst1	light
	%efrst1
	You are wandering around in some dense forest. East, the forest
	continues, and to the south lie heathlands. West are the foothills of a
	majestic mountain, which towers high up above the clouds. Your progress
	north is blocked by an ornate wall, decorated in exotic, eastern
	patterns, which stops at the base of an enormous cliff at roughly the
	same spot the forest ends to the west.
nfrst2	light
	%efrst1
	You find yourself stood in a section of dense forest, which continues to
	the west and southeast. Through the trees to the east can be seen the
	tower of what looks to be a belfry, and south is heath. Northwards is
	a strange, ornate wall, curiously enlivened by all manner of stylised
	eastern symbols.
nfrst3	light
	%efrst1
	You are wandering around in some dense forest to the north of some
	sprawling heathlands. Eastwards is the bank of a fast-flowing river,
	and northwest the forest continues. To the north, however, through the
	trees, can be seen a clearing containing some sort of edifice.
nhill1	light
	Foothills.
	These are the rolling foothills of a majestic mountain which towers
	high above you some way to the north, beyond some higher foothills.
	South is an east-west road, across which can be seen yet more foothills
	of a slightly smaller mountain. East lies a deep valley, which rises up
	into a heath to the northeast of where you stand. West is a sturdy wall,
	too large to scale.
nhill2	light
	%nhill1
	You are stood amongst the foothills of a majestic mountain, which rises
	to the north. South and northeast are more foothills, and east lies a
	heath. Your movement west is prevented by a large wall, built to repel
	intruders such as yourself.
nhill3	light
	%nhill1
	You are clambering about the foothills of a majestic mountain which
	climbs above the clouds to the north. Unfortunately, there is a towering
	cliff there, too large to ascend, but part of the mountain, to the west,
	is accessible. Southwest lie further foothills, and southeast is all
	heath. Northeast is a forest.
nmtn1	light
	Forested part of north mountain.
	You are stood in amongst some trees which cloak the lower slopes of a
	majestic mountain, rising to the north above the timber-line. West, the
	forest becomes too dense for you to proceed, and south is a wall, also
	blocking your way. All other directions, the mountain continues,
	although southeast is only foothills.
nmtn2	light
	North mountain.
	You are scaling the lower slopes of a majestic mountain. Its peak lies
	high above the clouds far to the north, although progress that way is
	only limited due to an interposing cliff which stands out boldly after
	some more climbable slopes. South are foothills.
nmtn3	light
	%nmtn2
	You are standing in the lower slopes of a majestic mountain, which
	rises to the north and descends to the east and south into foothills.
nmtn4	light
	%nmtn2
	You are scrambling up the slopes of a majestic mountain which spears
	through the clouds far to the north, above a steep cliff. East lie
	foothills, and there are lower slopes to the south. The sheer
	immensity of the mountain takes your breath away.
nmtn5	light
	%nmtn2
	You are stood in the lower slopes of a majestic mountain beside a
	huge cliff to the north, which towers high above you. So rugged is the
	cliff that you cannot climb it, only gasp at the geological wonder of
	it all. The mountain slopes downwards to the south, and continues at the
	same level to the west.
nmtn6	light
	%nmtn2
	You are in the corner of a horseshoe-shaped cliff, which curves round
	from the north to the west, blocking your way. All around you in other
	directions lie the slopes leading up to the cliff, which towers high
	above you, ending just below the clouds.
nmtn7	light
	%nmtn2
	You are ascending the lower slopes of a majestic mountain, which
	forces its way through the clouds further to the north, above a rugged
	cliff beyond where the slopes end. The cliff curves round, and blocks
	your immediate passage to the west, although in other directions the
	comparatively gentle slopes lead down to the foothills.
nmtn8	light
	%nmtn2
	You are climbing the slopes of a majestic mountain, which continue to
	rise awesomely in the northern and western directions, and descend less
	spectacularly to the south and east.
npstre	light
	North pasture.
	You are treading over the soft grass of a gorgeous pasture. To the north
	is a river, which continues to the northeast and flows beneath a
	mountain to the northwest. East, west and south, the pasture continues,
	yet to the southeast it becomes much rougher and more desolate. To the
	southwest lies forest.
orchrd	light
	Ancient orchard.
	You stand among the aged trees of an orchard. Most of them are apple
	trees, but there is the occasional pear tree to add character. None
	bear fruit or leaves, however, which makes the scene unnaturally
	desolate. East and west from here are normal forests, and southeast is a
	sweet meadow. South and southwest is a river, and north is a yard,
	beyond which is an inn.
pines1	light
	Pine forest.
	You are pushing your way through the pine needles in a dense forest.
	Eastwards, the make-up of the forest changes to normal, deciduous trees.
	Northeast is a pasture, and north can be smelled a fuming swamp. In all
	other directions the pines get thicker, and you probably won't be able
	to get through.
river1	light	death	hideaway
	You have left The Land.
river2	light
	Fast-flowing river.
	You are wading through a fast-flowing, yet shallow, river, which
	originates from a fork in a much faster river to the southeast, and
	continues to the northwest. North is an orchard, which by the northeast
	has become a normal forest. East is a meadow, south of which is a
	gazebo. To the west lies a lush pasture, but southwest it is rough and
	desolate.
river3	light
	%river2
	This is a river flowing from the southeast to the west. On the south
	bank lie exclusively pastures, and on the north, forest. The forest
	directly to the north seems to be an orchard of some kind, and through
	the trees there can be seen a building.
river4	light
	%river2
	You are stood by a river, flowing from the east to the west, where it
	disappears under a mountain. Foothills of the mountain are to the
	northwest, covered in forest which extends to the north of your current
	position, and become an orchard to the northeast. In all southerly
	directions are pastures of soft, deep-green grass.
road1	light
	Badly-paved road.
	You are stood on a badly-paved road between a mountain, to the north,
	and a wayside inn, to the south. East, the road fords a fast-flowing
	river, and west it continues. To the northeast is a ramshackle old
	building, and southeast there seems to be a well of some kind.
road2	light
	%road1
	You find yourself on a badly-paved road, which continues to the east and
	west. North and northeast are the lower regions of a mountain, which
	rises up beyond the clouds. Southeast is a yard, belonging to an inn
	which can be seen just beyond it. South is a briar patch, and southwest
	the foothills of a more impressive mountain. Northwest is a deep valley,
	whose western slopes rise up to the foothills of a mountain more
	majestic still. The view is quite breathtaking.
road3	light
	%road1
	You are walking along a badly-paved east-west road. From here can be
	seen three mountains: one to the northeast; one to the south and south-
	west; and one to the northwest, which is the largest. To the north,
	between two of the mountains, lies a deep valley. The only other nearby
	feature is a briar patch to the southeast.
road4	light
	%road1
	You are stood on a badly-paved road, which runs from the east to stop
	at a large wall constructed to the west. There is a narrow gap in this
	blockage, but it is so tight that if you wanted to go that way you'd
	have to drop everything to get through. North and south are the foot-
	hills of a pair of majestic mountains, and northeast is a deep valley.
rough	light
	Rough pasture.
	You are stood in a bleak, rough pasture. This seems to be due to the
	presence of an evil wood to the east and south, for north and west are
	more pastures which seem to be far greener and lusher than here. South-
	west is a forest, and northeast there seems to be a fast-flowing river.
sfrst1	light
	%efrst1
	You are standing in a dense forest. It continues to the southeast at
	a passable level, but south it is too thick to allow movement through.
	Westwards it becomes a pine forest. North, northeast and east are
	pastures, and northwest lies a festering, fuming swamp.
sfrst2	light
	%efrst1
	This is a forest, to the south of a pasture. The trees continue in most
	directions, but only to the northwest are they thinly spread enough to
	enable your walking through. Northwest is another pasture, but rougher
	than the first.
shill1	light
	%nhill1
	You are stood in among the foothills of a majestic mountain to the
	south. North is a narrow road which runs east-west, and everywhere else
	is more mountain. Your progress to the west is impeded by a strong wall,
	built to keep out trespassers.
shill2	light
	%nhill1
	You are standing in the foothills of a tall mountain, which rises away
	to the southwest. North is a badly-paved road, which runs east-west, and
	east is a briar patch. There are more foothills to the west, and to the
	south are forested slopes of the mountain.
smtn1	light
	South mountain.
	You are clambering around the slopes of a tall mountain, which rises up
	to the northeast into the clouds. North and east the mountain is at the
	same level as here, and to the southeast it slops down into a gentle
	pasture. Southwest is a swamp, fuming with marsh-gases, and west is the
	top of a tall cliff, which looks very dangerous...
smtn2	light
	%smtn1
	This is a steep climb at the base of a tall mountain. Further heights
	are to the west and northeast at this level (the latter area covered in
	forest), and north and northwest where the clouds hug the slopes. The
	mountain lowers slowly in the southerly directions to become pastures.
	East, a river flows and disappears under the mountain beneath where you
	now stand.
smtn3	light
	Forested part of south mountain.
	Your are stood amongst the trees in the forested slopes of the south
	mountain. There is more forest to the east, and the mountain ascends to
	the west, its peak hidden from view by the clouds near the top. North
	are foothills, and northeast a briar patch. Southeast flows a river.

	Top of south mountain
	You are standing at the very peak of the south mountain. A glorious
	view is to be beheld all around. To the northeast is a mountain, on
	the opposite side of a road from some building. To the north is a third
	mountain much larger than either of the other two, and far more
	majestic. South lie pastures, and southeast is an evil-looking wood,
	hard up against the side of a river, in which can be seen a small
	island. West, over a wall just visible through the clouds, is a stange,
	anachronistic world, centred around a house.
spstre	light
	South pasture.
	This is a pleasant pasture, which spreads far away in all the northerly
	directions; eastwards, it becomes rougher. There is forest everywhere
	else.

stable
	Stable.
	This ramshackle old stone building is what is left of a once proud
	stable. It has sadly fallen into disrepair, due to the constant
	battering of the elements, nestled as it is to the southeast of a
	towering mountain. To the east is a river bank, the river running
	north-south and forded to the southeast of where you now stand. To
	the southwest, running west from the ford, is a badly-paved road,
	beside which is an inn, the patrons of which stabled their horses here
	before The Land became what it is today.

	Ford across river.
	You are stood on a ford across a fast-flowing river. To the west is a
	badly-paved road, which carries on into the distance. Northwest is a
	ramshackle old building, and southwest is some sort of well. South lies
	a forest, and north is the west bank of the river you now cross. The
	east bank leads away, out of The Land.

	This is a beautiful and awesome sight. You are stood in a deep valley,
	carved between two tall mountains, to the west and east, eons ago. The
	steep slopes are barely climbable, and abound in curious fauna and
	strange, half-shadowed creatures. South, outside the valley, is an
	east-west road, and north is heathland. This place is very eerie.
wayout	light	nolook	chain	mud	start
	You force yourself through the narrow gap...
wellrm	light
	Well near inn.
	You stand beside what used to be a well, but which on closer inspection
	seems to be blocked off now. West is an inn, for which the well was
	probably originally constructed, although some way to the east can be
	heard running water. North is an east-west road, and southwest an
	orchard of mainly apple trees. Southeast is dense forest.
wfrst1	light
	%efrst1
	This is dense forest, at the bottom of a majestic mountain to the west.
	The trees continue up the mountain, and there is an orchard to the east.
	North is a briar patch, and south is an east-west flowing river. To the
	Northeast is a yard adjacent to an old inn.
wpstre	light
	West pasture.
	This is a pasture which sprawls at the feet of a majestic mountain to
	the north. The pasture continues to the east and southeast, but south
	and southwest are forests. West, the pasture ends beside a fuming swamp.
yard1	light
	Side yard of inn.
	This is a narrow yard at the western side of an inn. North is a badly-
	paved raod, and west a briar patch. Southeast, the yard becomes the back
	yard of the inn.
yard2	light
	Back yard of inn.
	This is a wide yard to the south of an old tavern, and continues to the
	side of it to the northwest. South is an orchard, and southwest is a
	forest. To the east there seems to be a well, near the inn.

1001	Testing, testing, one two?
	?Illegal memory reference at user PC 100160
1002	The river is flowing too fast for you to be able to cross.
1003	Your way is blocked by the ornate wall.
1004	You cannot move that way for the tall hedge.
1005	The forest becomes too dense to move in that direction.
1006	The wall is too high to climb.
1007	The mountain is too steep to ascend in that direction.
1008	The pines are too thick for you to go that way.
1009	You can't go that way! It's an enormous cliff!
1010	The swamp is too treacherous to travel in that direction.
1011	You're already here! Have a look around if you don't believe me!
1012	There's only one hint at the moment: it's useless asking for hints!
1013	The surface of the wall is too smooth to climb.
1014	Use "in" if you want to enter something, as "enter" is reserved for
	entering objects within a room. At the moment, there aren't any such
	objects, but the term is preserved for compatibility with MUD.
1015	Use "out" if you want to leave somewhere, as "leave" is reserved for
	leaving objects within a room. At the moment, there aren't any such
	objects, but the term is preserved for compatibility with MUD.
1016	The river's too fast to swim in, I'm afraid.
1017	There's no water here!
1018	You flap your wings and...nothing happens.
1019	Why worship? There aren't any gods around.
1020	Tap...tap...tappity-tap...
1021	There aren't any trees here, and nothing else is fell-able.
1022	That's the last time you'll see that! It floats off down the river
	at a great speed, and fast disappears from view...
1023	The object flushes away. Now where do you suppose THAT went?
1024	>>>>>SPARE<<<<<
1025	The water isn't deep enough to swim in.
1026	The gap is too narrow, you'll have to drop everything to get through.
1027	The vampire shies away from you.
1028	The vampire's chilling touch makes you feel cold all over.
1029	Your breath smells a bit, but it was quite tasty!
1030	With a touch of annoyance, you pick it up.
1031	The matchbox is now open.
1032	It's already open, look at it!
1033	The matchbox is now closed.
1034	You can't close closed matchboxes, or is that too hard a concept for
	you to grasp?
1035	The match is already alight! Do something, before it goes out!
1036	The match is spent, they only light the once...
1037	The match bursts into flame!
1038	The match isn't lit.
1039	The match has gone out.
1040	The stick is already alight.
1041	The match isn't lit anyway.
1042	The match goes out.
1043	It's a safety match, you need the box.
1044	The match's flame doesn't give off enough heat to do it.
1045	The match is unaffected.
1046	The beacon quickly catches fire, and is soon burning well.
1047	It's already lit...sigh.
1048	The match won't light anything as large as a beacon.
1049	When you light the last unlit beacon, a great thrill runs through
	your body at the magnificence of it all.
1050	It doesn't work me old mate.
1051	You'd set fire to the container!
1052	The match and matchbox burn away.
1053	The matchbox is closed, how do you expect to put anything in it? Let
	me guess - you're thick.
1054	The beacon isn't alight, chum.
1055	The beacon is too hot to get close enough to light anything, although
	you could perhaps be able to stand a stick held at arm's length.
1056	You can't get close enough to the beacon to douse it, it's too hot.
1057	It's not alight anyway.
1058	The matchbox is closed, open it to empty it.
1059	The matchbox is closed, open it if you want to remove something.
1060	OK, so you know all the nursery rhymes...
1061	The troll reels back in terror as you brandish your brand, but it's
	too late and your strike scorches deep into its flesh.
1062	It's just BEEN sheared, it's got no wool on!
1063	The ram wants nothing to do with the silver fleece.
1064	The fleece glows a white light for an instant, then transmutes to
	silver! Naturally you remove it from the ram as soon as this happens,
	about which the ram seems relieved.
1065	You swat the butterfly stone dead, but it disintigrates in the process.
	Don't be TOO upset, they don't live that long anyway!
1066	>>>>>SPARE<<<<<
1067	The trees are unclimbable, even the ones that aren't too tall are still
	too branchy.
1068	The troll won't let you near it, it's prepared to kill rather than
	give up its treasure!
1069	The cat doesn't want to be picked up, and successfully avoids your
	attempts to do so.
1070	Nope, it's too prickly.
1071	A crossbow bolt thuds into your chest!
1072	It's already loaded! They only take one bolt at a time, you know...
1073	The crossbow is now loaded.
1074	The crossbow can only be loaded with quarrels. If you've got one, why
	not try loading it with that?
1075	The bolt is in too tight to unload the crossbow, you'll have to shoot
	it at something or someone to get it out.
1076	It already is unloaded, don't you believe the descriptions you're given?
1077	You score a direct hit!
1078	The crossbow misfires and embeds the bolt deep in the ground where you
	can't recover it.
1079	It's not loaded...
1080	Your crossbow jams when you aim at your target. Who says black cats
	aren't lucky?
1081	You score a direct hit, but it has no effect on the undead!
1082	It's too small, you miss...
1083	You can only shoot targets in the same room as you, the crossbow is only
	effective over short ranges.
